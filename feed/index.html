				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the crystals from my last post I sent them along on the last Diamond trip we had to <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I04">beamline I04</a> but regrettably didn’t get any usable datasets. Perhaps fortunately there is a possible explanation for this that isn’t just ‘the crystals were a bit too rubbish’. We send our crystals to the Diamond Light Source and because of the high number of crystals sent on each trip by the department (124 on the last trip) not everyone goes along on every trip and we quite often use something called ‘auto-centering’ that uses a computer algorithm to find the edge of the loop and to align the loop and your crystal in the beam. Centering is necessary but also quite tricky, because to collect a data set you need ‘slices’ of data taken with the crystal at different angles so the loop the crystals are mounted in, is rotated by a robotic arm so that the crystal also rotates around inside the x-ray beam. Thus if your crystal isn’t aligned properly, as the loop rotates it moves you crystal out of the beam and thus you get no data at that point.</p>
<p>Usually the automatic alignment is really good, however this time around it didn’t work so well and quite often either my crystal wasn’t in the beam at all (it mistook the loop stem for the crystal) or it started in the beam and then rotated out of it (which is what I think happened in the case shown below where you can see two ‘periods’ of data with dips in between. This is, of course, suboptimal and leads to a data set that you can’t really use.</p>
<p>I’m resending the crystals to the beamline this Friday and hopefully going with them myself. The silver lining to this is that I know that some of them definitely diffract which is encouraging. Hopefully they’ll behave well when fully in the beam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again. My apologies for the delay in posting &#8211; I&#8217;ve been busy with other projects lately. As a follow up to my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/finally-finding-an-antibody-to-detect-ezh1-protein-expression/">previous</a> post, we wanted to further confirm our EZH1 antibody and test it in a knockout line. To do this, we generated a CRISPR knockout of EZH1 in an AML cell line that will be a great tool for future experiments. To generate the knockout line, we were helped by Fraser Soares, a postdoctoral fellow in Hansen He&#8217;s lab. He provided us with an AML cell line (OCI-AML-3) that expresses Cas9, along with guide RNAs that would allow us to knockout EZH1. Once the knockouts were generated, we tested the expression of EZH1 and EZH2. We determined that the guides knocked out EZH1, but had no effect on related EZH2 expression levels (Figure 1). We can now conclude we have a specific EZH1 antibody and EZH1 knockout lines that we can use in the future. For full experimental details, please see <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2718713#.XNXV6TBKjIU">Zenodo</a> post.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that it was possible to extend the aliphatic group on the carboxylic chain to further increase potency and potentially improve selectivity towards USP5 Zf-UBD. We ordered and tested these compounds- experimental details can be found on<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2677941#.XNL_W-hKjIU"><strong> Zenodo. </strong></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the follow-up co<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">mpounds with extended aliphatic groups on the carboxylic chain showed no significant binding (KD &gt;1 mM) to USP5; the extension of the methyl group does not seem to be tolerated (Figure 2).  </span></p>

<p>Next, we’ll be looking for different compounds scaffolds through a larger virtual screen using Molecular Forecaster’s FITTED docking platform.</p>
<p>On another note, a chemical functionality feature is being introduced to the open lab notebook platform. This feature will allow users to upload SDF files or draw chemical structures and readers will be able to make substructure searches against all future notebook records (Figure 3).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/1.htm">Stem cells</a> are a set of cells that, unlike most cells in the body, can divide as many times as they want, and can turn into any cell in the body. The mutations in cancer often make the cells behave more like stem cells, because in order to grow into a large tumour they may need to divide hundreds or thousands of cells, and it can allow a single cell to escape to another part of the body and grow into a second tumour (this is called metastasis). Knowing whether all of the cells in a tumour, or even a small proportion of them behave like this, and whether they&#8217;re killed by new therapies can be important information &#8211; if just one of these cells survives theoretically they can regrow into an entire new tumour.</p>
<p>And this ability to regenerate an tumour is just how we test how many of these cells are present: I developed an assay where I dilute the cells until I can seed just a handful into each well, and then I count how many new colonies (like tiny tumours) have grown.</p>
<p>I then used a statistical rule (called <a href="http://www.biology-pages.info/L/LimitingDilution.html">the Poisson distribution</a>) and a programming package (called R) to work out at what dilution there is just one stem-like cell present i.e. if only one stem cell is present when I seeded 5 cells then 20% are stem-like.</p>

Where this line crosses -1 indicates where 1 stem-like cell is present.</p></div>
<p>Although I need to repeat it to make sure the result is reliable, it seems that almost all of the cells in this line are stem-like! <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2669443">If you&#8217;d like to read about the technical details of this experiment you can do so here.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to develop ligands addressing different possible binding sites of the transcription factor brachyury, fragments co-crystallized with this protein should be developed into ligands by using the program Spark<sup>TM </sup>(Cresset<sup><span style="font-size: 11.25px;">®</span></sup>).</p>
<p>Brachyury (T, TBXT) is an essential regulator of the notochord development. Brachyury is primarily expressed in the embryo but not in the majority of normal adult tissue. It is known that brachyury is overexpressed in chordoma, a primary bone cancer, and plays a role in the disease pathogenesis. Chordoma affects the skull-base, the mobile spine and the sacrum. It is a slow-growing, malign cancer that is locally invasive and has a tendency to recur although a surgical and/or radiation therapy was conducted.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>It is hypothesized that chordoma is originated from embryonic notochordal remnants. Brachyury is proposed to act as an aberrantly activated transcription factor and thereby be oncogenic. No approved targeted therapies, chemotherapies or immunotherapies are available for chordoma and no small-molecule inhibitors for brachyury have been developed.<sup>1 </sup>Therefore, a fragment-based approach should be explored to develop ligands for brachyury to study this protein.</p>
<p>Our colleagues Joseph Newman and Opher Gileadi at SGC Oxford co-crystallized wild-type human brachyury protein with various fragments which bind to the sites A-E (Figure 1, left). Thankfully, they provided the fragment and protein structures to us so that we can explore the usage of the Spark<sup>TM </sup>growing approach to develop ligands for these binding sites.</p>

Left: Aligned X-ray structures of the human wild-type brachyury protein in complex with fragments at different binding sites (A-E). These first crystallization structures contain Cd<sup>2+</sup>ions (green balls). Right: Binding site A close to loop with D177 and in proximity to residue Y88.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>First, we focused on binding site A since most fragments bind to this binding site and site A is close to a loop that is mutated in chordoma-linked variant G177D<sup>3 </sup>and to the amino acid residue Y88 that, if mutated, affects binding to effector proteins<sup>4 </sup>(Figure 1, left).</p>

<p>Figure 2. Fragment <strong>1 </strong>and <strong>2 </strong>co-crystallized in the binding site A of wild-type TBXT.</p>
<p>21 fragments were co-crystallized to binding site A. In Figure 2, the binding modes of two co-crystallized fragments are displayed. Fragments <strong>1 </strong>and <strong>2 </strong>show interactions or close proximity to two of the three amino acids Ser129, Ser89 and Arg180. Therefore, the growing approach of the program Spark<sup>TM </sup>should be used to identify new ligands that are able to form all three interactions. One growing approach started from the amino group of fragment <strong>1 </strong>and was guided by fragment <strong>2 </strong>towards the region of its carboxylate group (Figure 3).</p>

<p>Figure 3: Spark<sup>TM </sup>growing approach starting from fragment <strong>1 </strong>towards Arg180 guided by fragment <strong>2</strong>. The functional groups of fragments <strong>1 </strong>and <strong>2 </strong>revealing H-bond interactions with amino acid residues are marked with the following colors: Ser129 (red), Ser89 (blue), Arg180 (green).</p>
<p>To achieve new ligands with similar properties in certain areas so-called field points were used. They are ‘condensed representations of electrostatic, hydrophobic and shape properties’ (Cresset<sup><span style="font-size: 11.25px;">®</span></sup>) of those areas where they are placed by the program Spark<sup>TM</sup>. Regarding the growing approach of fragment <strong>1 </strong>and <strong>2 </strong>the hydrophobic field point of the phenyl ring and the negative field point of the carboxylate group of fragment <strong>2 </strong>were used. In total three of the 21 fragments bound to site A were used as starting points and each of them were grown in the area of two different fragments. The results were clustered by Spark<sup>TM </sup>depending on their structural similarity. Those compounds with the highest score of the first 20 clusters ranked according their scores were chosen to analyze their interactions by docking into binding site A using the docking program Flare<sup>TM </sup>(Cresset<sup><span style="font-size: 11.25px;">®</span></sup>). 4,000 docking results were inspected visually and compounds with a high docking score, high electrostatic complementarity and high number of interactions to the binding site were picked.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the docking pose of the example compound <strong>3 </strong>that was obtained by docking <strong>3 </strong>in binding site A of brachyury using Flare<sup>TM</sup>. Besides other criteria like docking score and electrostatic complementarity following interactions of <strong>3 </strong>are promising for the co-crystallization of this compound with brachyury: two H-bond interactions of the positively charged amino moiety to Ser129 and His126, the proximity of the amide carbonyl-group to Ser89 and the H-bond interactions of the oxazole O-atom and N-atom towards Arg180.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2765 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture4-300x232.png" alt="" width="454" height="351" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture4-300x232.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Picture4.png 633w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" />Figure 4. Binding mode of new compound <strong>3 </strong>obtained by docking into binding site A of wild-type brachyury with Flare<sup>TM</sup>. H-bond interactions are marked with green dotted lines.</p>
<p>Additionally, new compounds were obtained by searching in the Enamine REAL database for similar compounds to those compounds that were found by the Spark<sup>TM </sup>approach and that showed promising docking results in Flare<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p>A selection of compounds that are identical or slightly different than those found in the Spark<sup>TM </sup>approach as well as compounds that represent similar ones to the Spark<sup>TM </sup>hits were purchased and will be tested regarding their ability to co-crystallize with brachyury. If the compounds bind to this transcription factor, they will represent promising starting points for future ligands of brachyury.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been lucky enough to have a student (Mira) in the lab working with me for the past few weeks and so I’d like to write about the work that we’ve been doing together.</p>
<p>We spent some time cleaning up an old sample of ALK2 that Ros had left over in the freezer to set up in crystal plates with some compounds from M4K Pharma that they were relatively keen to see the structures of.</p>
<p>We used a specialised coarse screen that Ros had designed containing only conditions where we had previously seen crystals in the wider coarse screens. This means that we can narrow down the field where we’re expecting to find crystals and test fewer conditions to find the one we need – this means setting up fewer plates and thus needing less protein per compound tested, so is overall more efficient.</p>
<p>We set up the plates (at 4C and 20C) at around 9mg/ml with compounds M4K2163, M4K2143, M4K2192, M4K2207 and M4K2194 at 1mM concentration from 25mM stocks.</p>
<p>We found some interesting crystals, one of which was mountable as is (from M4K2192) and several across all the compounds, which showed small crystals that would be worth following up in more specific conditions.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2754" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M4K2192.png" alt="" width="403" height="294" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M4K2192.png 403w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M4K2192-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p><em>Crystals of ALK2/ACVR1A with compound M4K2192</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Mira designed some follow up screens based on the conditions that showed small crystals and we set up some more plates with those conditions in the hope of turning those small crystals into larger, better crystals. We had enough protein to set up followup plates for compounds M4K2163 and M4K2143 at 9.5mg/ml. From these plates we mounted 5 crystals across the board and combined with those above ended up with crystals of unknown quality across three compounds. These have been confirmed as containing protein by imaging the drops by UV light (UV light interacts with protein to make crystals only visible under UV light if they contain protein rather than just being salt) and are now waiting to be sent to the synchrotron to see if they actually diffract or not.  You can read more about the technical details <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2650203#.XMB29jBKiUk">here on Zenodo.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>–       3-year PhD funded by CNRS for genomics and transcriptomics data analysis of the <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria parasite.</strong></p>
<p><strong>–       In a young dynamic team based in Montpellier, South of France, with many worldwide collaborators</strong></p>
<p><strong>–       Keywords: population genetics &amp; genomics, single-cell RNA-seq, molecular epidemiology, antigenic variation.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>
<p>Most malaria deaths are caused by <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, a unicellular eukaryote parasite transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Despite the heavy burden of the disease, most human infections are asymptomatic (afebrile) and can last for months/years. In regions where malaria is seasonal, such as in The Gambia, West Africa, these asymptomatic infections probably act as a reservoir during the dry season when there is no or little transmission. <strong>Long-lasting infections could be turned to our advantage if we study them as a new host-pathogen interaction model</strong>, by regular sampling of an asymptomatic volunteer, investigating the parasite biology in its natural environment. More details on our research can be found on this <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/plasmodium-falciparum-asymptomatic-infections-in-search-of-the-elephant-in-the-room/">on this post</a>.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2017, we collected fingerprick blood samples every 3 months in a population of ~1000 inhabitants in a Gambian village. At the start of the 2017 dry season, we also recruited a cohort of 50 volunteers who were all asymptomatic carriers for <em>P. falciparum</em>. Monthly blood samples were taken for 6 months over the entire dry season. A total of 435 blood samples were collected, including this time series of monthly samples from the same volunteers over a 6-month period. <strong>This dataset represents a unique opportunity to address novel questions about the parasite biology</strong>. More specifically, we are interested in discovering how the parasite establishes a chronic infection, through changes at the transcriptomic levels.</p>
<p><strong>Your projects</strong></p>
<p>Projects here under are only a suggestion, the exact project will be defined based on the student’s abilities and expertise. Your work will be entirely computer-based, but you will be part of a  team mixing ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ lab research.</p>
<p><strong>Project 1: <em>P. falciparum</em> population genetics and genomics</strong></p>
<p>As outlined above, we collected blood samples all year round from a village over two and a half year. <em>P. falciparum</em> DNA was extracted and genotyped and/or whole genome sequenced in collaboration with MalariaGEN at the Sanger Institute. A dataset of about 400 parasite DNA barcodes and 100 parasite genomes is now available. Here we want to describe the first parasite genomes sequenced from asymptomatic infections, and investigate the impact of the dry season selective pressure on the parasite population. This longitudinal approach also allows us to tackle the question of the duration of a <em>P. falciparum</em> chronic infection. Preliminary analysis revealed, for example, that a child was infected asymptomatically with the same <em>P. falciparum </em>strain for over 2.5 years. This overturns the dogma on duration of a <em>P. falciparum</em> infection.</p>
<p>Your task is to fully characterise the parasite population genetic diversity, using genotyping, genomic and epidemiologic data. The analysis will include PCA, Fst, chromosome painting, EHH, iHS, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Project 2: Can <em><u>P. falciparum</u></em> sense its environment and adapt to it via transcriptional regulation?</strong></p>
<p>In areas where rains are seasonal, two distinct patterns of malaria fluctuate, from high prevalence with a wide range of clinical outcome in the wet season, to low prevalence mainly asymptomatic in the dry season. The mechanisms allowing the parasite to survive in chronic infections during the dry season, and restart transmission as vector population increases with the ensuing wet season, remain to be investigated. We hypothesize that <em>P. falciparum</em> is able to sense its environment and dampens its virulence with seasonality.</p>
<p>In collaboration with colleagues at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Trop Med, we are currently optimizing a single-cell RNA-seq approach to <em>P. falciparum</em>.</p>
<p>Your task, using ‘bulk’ and single-cell parasite transcriptomes, is to identify differentially regulated genes in the dry vs wet season, in symptomatic vs asymptomatic infections, and identify putative candidates involved in cell growth. The analysis will include normalization, PCA for clustering and tSNE for representation, correlating bulk and single cell data with Pearson correlation, drawing gene co-expression networks within each identified cluster (subpopulation), etc.</p>
<p>The transcriptome dataset, which will be linked with <em>in vitro </em>growth assays, will be crucial in understanding how the parasite successfully establishes a chronic infection over the dry season, yet triggers a new epidemic over the following transmission season. It also has the potential of identifying dormant parasites, a discovery that would guide malaria elimination strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Other projects:</strong></p>
<p>– Population genomics with over 100 <em>P. falciparum</em> genomes collected from severe malaria or uncomplicated cases in Benin. In collaboration with Gwladys Bertin (Paris), Joe Zhu and Jacob Garcia (Oxford, UK).</p>
<p>– Identification of the micro-indels and structural variant mutation rates in <em>P. falciparum</em> in vitro using data from “clone trees” (Hamilton 2016 NAR and unpublished data).</p>
<p>– And many, many more…</p>

<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>Antoine Claessens (PI) is a malariologist who trained at Edinburgh University, the Sanger Institute, LSHTM and the MRC-Gambia. He recently joined Montpellier University as a “Chargé de Recherche INSERM”. He was awarded an ATIP and an ANR-JC.</p>
<p>Currently the team consists of one post-doc and one Master student. Two PhD students will be recruited around Sep 2019, one for lab-based research and one for data analysis (this advert).  Each year, 2 Master students in bioinformatics / epidemiology will join the team for up to 6 months. We are likely to recruit another post-doc towards late 2019.</p>
<p><strong>What you can expect / what we can offer</strong></p>
<p>The 3-year PhD will be funded by CNRS (substantially higher salary than other sources of funding). You will be part of <a href="http://www.dimnp.univ-montp2.fr/">DIMNP</a> and you will closely interact with experienced bioinformaticians from the bioinformatics platform and with population geneticists from <a href="https://www.mivegec.ird.fr/fr/">MIVEGEC</a>. Both ‘UMR’ are very international, with highly competent and friendly scientists. More generally, Montpellier is a large hub for research in Life Sciences, particularly in the field of evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>I will try my best to transmit my passion about <em>P. falciparum</em> biology; you might find yourself dreaming about <em>var</em> genes too. As we will be a small team, you can expect more of my time dedicated to you, but I do not want to micromanage. I expect you to work hard, yet you will have freedom on working hours etc. All our current research projects are in collaboration with international laboratories, there is an opportunity to work in the USA/UK for a short period of time. If you are planning to stay in academic research, I will help you secure a post-doc position.</p>
<p>If you are from abroad: Being able to speak French is not a requirement; your colleagues will speak English fluently. We will help you with the administrative task of moving to France.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/collecting-hao1-crystal-structures-with-follow-up-compounds-based-on-fragment-hits/">last post</a>, I told you I had soaked my follow-up compounds into HAO1 crystals to start developing structural explanations of how these compounds work. So far I have analysed four interesting protein-compound structures: 2 at the active site, 1 at the gating loop and 1 at the oligomeric interface. Full experimental details can be found in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2650545#.XMGu9jBKiUk">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The first structure had a compound derived from fragment 1 bound at the active site. This compound (5-bromo-N-methyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide; FUP1A for short) expands fragment 1 in two directions: adding a bulky, hydrophobic bromine to the aromatic ring and adding a methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) to the carboxamide (CO-NH) at the other end of the molecule (figure 1C). FUP1A shows more typical displacement of the substrate-coordinating tryptophan (Trp110), rotating this residues by 180° so that it points away from the substrate binding pocket (figure 1A). FUP1A binds further into the substrate binding pocket than the fragment, likely due to the addition of the bulky bromine, so that it is now in the same orientation as the published HAO1 inhibitors (CDST and CCPST, PDB codes <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2RDT">2RDT</a> and<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6GMC"> 6GMC</a> respectively) as illustrated in figure 1D.</p>
<p>When taken together with the potent activity assay result – an IC50 of 62 µM, 7X improvement over fragment 1 – for a similar compound (6-bromo-N-ethyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide; FUP1B; structure shown in figure 1D) with the bromine one position away and a longer extension (ethyl, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, rather than methyl) on the other side, this structure opens up some interesting questions. Does the orientation of fragment 1 reflect a more optimal position for the core scaffold? If so, does the ethyl group and/or the different position of the ethyl group of FUP1B allow it to maintain this position? Or do one or both of these groups disrupt the active site residues in an entirely different way? To answer these questions, I am currently working to obtain a structure with FUP1B bound.</p>
<p>The second structure was with a compound derived from fragment 2, also at the active site. This compound (6-amino-1-benzyl-5-(methylamino) pyrimidine-2, 4(1H, 3H)-dione; FUP2A) was chosen to explore alternate groups for the second half of fragment 2, replacing the original ring (cyclohexane) with an aromatic one (benzene), since the former did not seem to contribute to fragment binding. FUP2A did not show much improvement in the activity assay over fragment 2 and this is reflected by the bound structure, which shows that FUP2A and fragment 2 bind in very similar poses with the same displacement of Trp110 (figure 1B). As well as validating this scaffold as a consistent HAO1-binder, this follow up structure suggests that the best way to continue development would be to expand from other positions on the substituted ring, to better disrupt active site residues.</p>

Comparison of FUP1A (purple) and FUP2A (yellow) with the published inhibitors, CDST (green) and CCPST (orange), shown as sticks.</em></p>
<p>The third structure is of a compound bound at the gating loop and derived from fragment 5 (figure 2B). This compound (2-((4H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl) thio)-1-(4-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazin-1-yl) ethan-1-one; FUP5A) replaces the fluoride on the original phenyl ring with a chloride at a different position (4-fluoro to 3-chloro) and extends the opposite end of the compound with a sulphur and a nitrogen-rich aromatic ring (triazole) (Figure 3B). FUP5A superimposes fairly well with its parent fragment at the piperazine (six-membered, non-aromatic ring with a nitrogen at either end) with the piperazine displacing the sidechain of Tyr134 and the substituted phenyl ring continuing to disrupt the gating loop (Figure 2A). the extension at the opposite end of the molecule does not cause the same conformational change (shift of helix 4) but rather points mostly out towards the solvent, not forming further interactions with the protein (Figure 3A). This structure suggests that larger extensions from the phenyl end may be more effective in disrupting the gating loop but care is needed in extending the other end of the molecule to avoid losing efficiency by including non-interacting chemical groups.</p>

<p>The final structure has a compound derived from fragment 6 bound at the subunit interface. This compound (1-(5-chloro-pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-(pyridin-2-yl)-piperazine; FUP6A) extends the fragment scaffold, essentially in a straight line, by the addition of two further rings and the structure shows that it binds in the same manner –  through hydrophobic interactions with both subunits and pi-stacking with the ring of Tyr163 on one subunit (figure 3A). The fact that FUP6A can bind with the HAO1 tetramer intact explains why it did not show much inhibition in the activity assay and this structure also helps to further map the binding pocket at the interface. Taken together with the more potent follow up compounds (e.g. FUP6B, FUP6C, shown in figure 3B), this structure validates the need for bulky additions perpendicular to the core scaffold (like the two fluorides in FUP6B) to more effectively disrupt the HAO1 tetramer.</p>

<p>Since some compounds may require greater movements of the gating loop or tetramer subunits than can be freely accommodated within preformed crystals, I am also trying to co-crystallise with the most promising hits. This involves adding one compound per aliquot of freshly purified HAO1 protein before setting up trials to screen a wide range of crystallisation conditions. Co-crystallisation experiments requiring more time and resources than soaking but do have a few benefits: a greater number of conditions can be tested to look for those that only yield crystals with a given ligand; a lower concentration of compound can be used to achieve an equivalent saturation of the protein; and binding of the compound occurs <em>in solution,</em> accommodating a greater degree of flexibility. To this end, I have set up crystal plates with the 13 top compounds (4 active site, 6 gating loop and 3 interface), which have yielded a number of likely-looking crystals that I will be screening over the coming weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve got a few things to catch up with on the blog – one of them is to talk about a conference I attended in Oxford recently. I attended the <a href="https://www.biochemistry.org/Events/tabid/379/MeetingNo/SA217/view/Conference/Default.aspx">Biochemical Society BMP Signalling in Cancer II</a> meeting which was held in St. Annes College, Oxford. At this meeting I presented a poster on the work I’ve been doing (and which has been written about here as it’s happened) on looking at how the mutations in ALK2 effect the underlying activity of the kinase as well as effecting how well FKBP12 can inhibit ALK2.</p>
<p>The conference brought together 60 researchers in the field from around the world talking about a variety of different cancers but also other BMP related conditions such as FOP. Over three days there were some fantastic talks by the leaders in the field including from Dr. Caroline Hill from the Crick Institute in London who spoke about receptor cross talk in BMP signalling and how that might affect signalling through ALK2 and Prof. Eileen Shore from the university of Pennsylvania who spoke about mechanosensing and tissue stiffness in FOP.</p>
<p>I had a chance to get into some really interesting conversations with some of the attendees about the way their work and my work intersected and how we might be able to collaborate in the future – particularly interesting was talking to some Postdocs from Caroline Hill’s group who are looking at similar problems to me but from an in-cell perspective rather than using purified proteins. From that some interesting questions have been thrown up that I now want to test in my in-vitro systems and that will be detailed here as and when I’ve had a chance to try them. Hopefully this can lead to validation of both my work and theirs by complementing in-vivo and in-vitro approaches.</p>
<p>I thought it would be good to share the poster I created here – so you can find it <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2640488#.XLRgljBKiUk">over on Zenodo</a>. It is designed for a scientific audience but not necessarily an FOP specialist audience so hopefully it should be fairly easy to follow. It leads the reader through the story of explaining that Gain of Function (GOF) mutations in ALK2 are involved in diseases like FOP and DIPG. I then go on to present data that shows that these mutations disrupt the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12 but that this isn’t the whole story (as regular readers of this blog will know). Then I talk about what I found out about what is needed for SMAD activation by ALK2 before looking at the increased phosphorylation of SMAD1 by the mutant ALK2 proteins compared to the wild type. This covers both the western blot data that shows more SMAD1 activation but also the mass spec data I’ve shared previously that looks at more SMAD1 and more ALK2 phosphorylation. Finally I showed the phosphomapping data on ALK2 that is starting to pick apart the exact phosphorylation locations on ALK2 that are necessary for SMAD1 activation (Also data I’ve talked about on this blog before). In this case it was nice to see that all the effort Rod and I had put into phosphomapping had paid off! Other groups had said they’d tried and been unable to map ALK2 using trypsin alone but our method of using 5 different enzymes both enriched and unenriched seems to have done the trick (despite it being 10x more work!).</p>
<p>There is great value from attending a conference like this and in this case I feel that I really did make some very important connections and had some very informative discussions that were directly relevant to my research and that will hopefully bear fruit in time and guide the direction of my experiments.</p>
