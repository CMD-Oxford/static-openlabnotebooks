		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tom, Yes completely agree, human neurons from the brain would be ideal much like in cancer where to study the human disease we can obtain cells from every patient biopsy, but getting neurons from the brain of a person comes with challenges. Often access to material is severely limited, and the quality can vary from surgery to surgery. It also depends on why the surgery was does, as often there was an underlying condition being corrected, so for tissue to be removed, it would mean there may be some underlying problem with the neurons and associated cells. The other deterring factor is while we can get tissue, it has a finite lifespan, and can&#039;t be expanded beyond what the starting material is. Stem cells at least alleviated a lot of these issues, we can grow a patients cells and make any cell type we want when we want, and we never have to worry about material being available. Yes it has its limitations, but it has opened up a lot of doors and possibilities that weren&#039;t there ten years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good day, 

I expect that I am incorrect with this idea, but I am wondering if brain neurons would be an option for you to use in your research if they are provided to you following brain surgery, and the patient agrees.

Thank you

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Marijan, Thanks for the comment. And lot of the reason for one hand being affected is due to the disease progression of PD within the brain. Often it is affecting certain motor coordination circuits, leading to one side being affected predominantly. In terms of electrical activity of neurons, there are many great researchers at the MNI looking at the connections and firing within the circuits of our brains, and how are brains fire is something we need to get better grasp on. For myelin damage, its more common to observe simply impaired firing and neuronal loss if the firing is prevented from severe damage. In terms of bone, the stem cell part is simply cells that exist to constantly replace and turnover bone. The exact mechanisms of stem cells in bone processing is quite complex and I am far from an expert in it. Hope this helps your questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hallo from Toronto.I was happy to come across this article.I have small trimers in my right hand.What makes hand move normaly and why is it shacking at the times by itself.And why not both arms??Recently I have been thinking a lot about muvement operating system in our body and how it works normaly and what hapens when it is not normal like Parkinson shaking.I love theories about Stem cells.I never hear anyone talking about electrical power in our body or electronics in our body or how many neuroscientistc know about electric power or what is a waltage in us.And if Myelin sheet gets damaged can the electricity make a short???And how Stem cels enter bone for procesing to cells???Please contact me.Thank you.]]></description>
