		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment Al!  I&#039;ve been able to locate reagents for knockdown of EZH1 to address the specificity of any band I might eventually get (but I am still searching for an antibody that gives me any sort of band of approximately the right size in a cells amenable to knockdown). I&#039;ll will investigate knockout options.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi G

I think you&#039;re embarking on an experiment (finding a useful antibody) that requires some thought.  If your antigen is EZH1, then I would as a matter of course, create (or get) an EZH1 knock-out cell lines and the parental control.  This is honestly the only un (less)biased way to know if you have an antibody that detects your antigen.  If it were me, I&#039;d test the lysates (+/- EZH1) on a Western, by IF and definitely by immunoprecipitation followed by MS (Marcon et al, Nature Methods) - and titre the antibodies.  And only bother to check if the antibodies are monoclonal (not worth the effort doing it for polyclinals).  After this set of experiments you will confidently be able to say that you have an EZH1 antibody worth using in an experiment - and the world will thank you for it (though the companies that sell non-specific antibodies may not :&#062;)
