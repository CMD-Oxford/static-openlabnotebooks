		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a fair point - I think my hope with at least the initial experiment was that if I had seen an association (and given it&#039;s presumed function in the pathway it wasn&#039;t an impossibility and I&#039;d have felt very foolish not to at least try such an easy experiment) I could have instantly set it up in crystal plates which would have been very interesting.
There have been a few studies indicating a few other potential binding partners including TOM1 which I&#039;ve looked at in the past and while I&#039;ve been able to detect an interaction by ITC I&#039;ve not been able to get a crystal structure. The fold of the DUF domain is similar to the fold of SUFU in the hedgehog pathway but there is very little sequence similarity so it&#039;s hard to predict how the binding site and substrates of SUFU will map to ZFYVE9C. 
In cell studies is something to consider too. It&#039;s not where my expertise lies but I&#039;m hoping to talk to Jong Fu about whether he&#039;s got any thoughts on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If it were me, I&#039;d drop it and think of a more agnostic (unbiased) way to test its function
Your approach is almost always a losing game, since a negative result is meaningless and it takes years to gain confidence in any interaction (since you &quot;forced&quot; the proteins to interact, you&#039;d need to go back into cells, do mutants etc)

so why not just start with the cell experiment and ask &quot;what co-purifies with it&quot;?]]></description>
