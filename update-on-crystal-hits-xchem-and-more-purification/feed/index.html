		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rezaul, thanks for that information - I might have a go at trying this if the new crystal system doesn&#039;t work. With fragment screening, one has to mount a couple of hundred crystals in a few hours, so digging around friable crystals trying to get the sticky skin off makes that amount of mounting very inefficient. Did you put the EG in the crystallisation condition or soak after the crystals grew?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent! Thanks for the post. One of my protein crystals were also grown inside the membrenous drops, as you described. Though after 20-30min of  tedious microsurgery under the microscope, I separated the crystals, but some sticky membrane fragments remained stuck with the crystals &#038; showed some smudgy diffractions. I added 5-15%% ethylene glycol in the protein condition &#038; that solved the membrane problem!]]></description>
