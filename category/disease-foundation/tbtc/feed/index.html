				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know as many as 30% of the cells in labs could be misidentified? And what a nightmare it would be to find out years of your work are just completely wrong because you got your skin cells mixed up with your brain cells&#8230;</p>
<p>So to avoid that catastrophe, I took some time to check the DNA sequence of the ACVR1 gene, because for this gene we know what should be mutated (or not) for each of my cell lines. This way I can make sure that I haven&#8217;t mixed them up in the past year (<em>and</em> that they haven&#8217;t picked up new mutations in this important area all by themselves).</p>
<p>All I had to do was collect the genomes of the cells, amplify specifically the ACVR1 gene, send it for overnight sequencing, and then I get a trace like this back from the facility:</p>
<div id="attachment_2544" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1.png"><img class="wp-image-2544 size-large" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-1024x396.png" alt="Sequencing trace covering the R206H mutation in ACVR1 found in FOP and DIPG" width="780" height="302" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-1024x396.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-300x116.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sequencing trace covering the R206H mutation in ACVR1 found in FOP and DIPG</p></div>
<p>Each DNA base has one peak, except one that has both a guanine (G) and an adenine (A) DNA base. The adenine, present on one chromosome, causes the change from an arginine (R) to a histidine (H) at the 206th position of the ACVR1 protein i.e. the R206H mutation.</p>
<p>This trace is from the HSJD-DIPG-007 cell line and is the mutation I expected. According to all my sequencing, none of my cell lines have gotten mixed up, yay!</p>
<p>You can read the full details of how I did this, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2579809#.XHgumMD7SUk">here on Zenodo</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve not posted in a while, mainly because things have been really busy, but good busy, as I now have 3 new datasets/structures, of ALK2 with M4K2118, M4K2149 and, amazingly, M4K2009. As you know, this is our lead candidate, which until now has not behaved very well in crystal trials, and it hasn’t been possible to get decent crystals. In my last post I told you how I had somehow managed to mix up the TNIK and ACVR1/ALK2 tubes when I was setting up the plates, and accidentally put ACVR1 into a coarse screen and TNIK into a fine screen for ACVR1. Well, after I got lovely big crystals for what I thought was ACVR1 with M4K3003, I sent them to the synchrotron, got beautiful data to 1.4 Å, phased it, and lo and behold! It was M4K2009 snugly fitted into the binding pocket (see the ligand density after molecular replacement below). Of course, I didn’t notice this was a trimethoxy containing compound (how??) before I excitedly emailed everyone to tell them I had M4K3003, and then had to retract … However, the story ends well as M4K2009 is really important.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2511" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="509" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-768x432.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, I got data for M4K2149 (~2.6 Å), one of the amide head group containing compounds we’re interested to see, and M4K2118 (~1.4 Å), which is doing well in some of the other assays too. I’ve put the .mtz files <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2573142#.XGw9g-j7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo if you want to play with high resolution data, and some images below showing the ligand density and the ligands binding in the pocket. The amide head group of M4K2149 appears to preserve the water network in the pocket that we’ve observed in other structures, but as the resolution is too low for waters, we can’t tell til we get higher resolution data. Which hopefully will be this week, as I’ve grown some really pretty crystals for M4K2149 that I hope will diffract better. These appeared quite by accident again, as I’d designed a fine screen around the D5 well condition of my mega composite screen, but neglected to notice when I validated the screen that I’d put 10 x less ammonium sulphate in one row than intended – should have been 0.9 M, but ended up being 0.09 M. I should probably start calling myself ‘the accidental crystallographer’ at this rate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2509" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve got some small crystals for M4K3007, another structure we really want, and some pretty ones for M4K2184, another amide head group compound. I’ve followed up the M4K3007, just waiting to see if anything appears, and will send the tiny ones to the synchrotron while waiting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2508" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png" alt="" width="849" height="478" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" /></p>
<p>I’m also very happy to say that our new M4K2117 crystal system for XChem fragment screening has worked very nicely so far, in the sense that the crystals are large and relatively robust and can handle soaking in low salt conditions as well as compounds with DMSO for a few hours. They then still diffract to around 1.2-1.8 Å, consistently in the same space group, C 1 2 1. This is a vast improvement over the previous system with LDN-193189. We did a solvent characterisation and pre-screen a couple of weeks ago with 100 crystals, and of the 20 or so hits we got, none was in the allosteric pocket we are looking for. This could be because of the 1.4 M ammonium sulphate and 0.2 M Na/K tartrate I have in there, which might prevent access of fragments to the pocket. Thus, using the remarkable shifter that Nathan Wright at SGC designed, we’ll be transferring loads of crystals from grow plates to low salt soak plates before doing the compound soaks this week, with the same 100 compounds, in order to check if the hit rate/location changes.</p>
<p>I will mention though, for anyone who may never have noticed this, the DMSO concentration in the protein solution for crystallisation is very important! I had previously been using Batch 1 of M4K2117 for my co-crystallisation, but it ran out so I used Batch 2, which was a 50 mM stock, as opposed to the previous 25 mM stock. The plates I set up with this, the same in every other way, gave showers of rather ugly, crunchy, small crystals. So I tried a few things – diluted the stock to 25 mM in DMSO and set up plates with that, with both lower and higher concentrations of protein (8 and 14 mg/ml along with the usual 10-11 mg/ml), as well as using the stock as is, with lower and higher protein concentrations. The lower stock concentrations brought back the big, perfect, beautiful crystals from before, the higher stock, no matter the protein concentration, gave ugly chunks and showers. The final concentration of compound was the same in all, so clearly the DMSO percentage is a very important factor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further down the line I want to be able to test the activation of the BMP signalling pathway downstream of the ALK2 receptor. For this I plan to use the alkaline phosphatase gene as a readout &#8211; it&#8217;s a well known gene activated downstream of BMP signalling so a lot of easy to use assays already exist for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/optimising-an-assay-to-detect-alkaline-phosphatase-activity-in-c2c12-cells/">when I tested this assay with the standard C2C12 cell line it didn&#8217;t work particularly well</a> so I&#8217;ve decided to try again with a new set of cells. This time I&#8217;m choosing connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) from FOP patients as a reporter cell line because they respond more strongly to the signals that activate the BMP pathway (called BMP ligands).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never worked with these cells before so, again, I needed to work out how many I&#8217;ll need to get a good result from the assay. These cells however grow as a very thin sheet which is so see-through that I initially couldn&#8217;t tell if the wells were full. To solve this I used stains called Calcein AM and Hoechst. Calcein AM can stain any living cell because they metabolise it from a see-through molecule into a fluorescent green product, whereas Hoechst can stick to DNA and turn all the cell nuclei blue, and so suddenly, all of my cells glow:</p>
<div id="attachment_2389" style="width: 1382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png"><img class="wp-image-2389 size-full" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png" alt="Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)" width="1372" height="784" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png 1372w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-300x171.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-768x439.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)</p></div>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they pretty?</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re this easy to see, it&#8217;s even easier to see how many cells are needed to fill a well, but not get overcrowded. You can read more about how I did that in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2546911">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The only question I have left is why some cells didn&#8217;t stain with Calcein AM, even though their nucleus looks fine? Anyone know the answer?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone and happy New Year! I really, really wanted to end the year on a high note in December before I went off on holiday, but as it turned out, I didn’t have enough time to set up 18 plates and write a blog post on the last day. So I’ll just have to start the year on a high note.</p>
<p>I’m very happy to say I got another ACVR1/ALK2 structure in December, at 2 Å resolution, co-crystallised with M4K2158 (see images below, and the .mtz autoprocessed file is available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo). The structure is not fully refined yet, but what’s interesting is the solvent side of the molecule is being stabilised by either a water contact (Chain A) or Asp293 (Chain B). This gives it really good density.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2367" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2367 " src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png" alt="" width="855" height="481" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 bound to M4K2158 at ~2 Å, showing interactions with His286 and a water at the back of the pocket</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also seem to have some new <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">pretty </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">hits with M4K2118, M4K2149 and M4K3003 (crystal pics below). What’s interesting about the M4K3003 hits is that I’ve really struggled to get crystals with this compound (as well as M4K3007 and 3010), and it is a pretty desirable structure. These hits came about as a result of a mistake, where I somehow managed to mix up my tubes and put ACVR1 with M4K3003 into my mega composite screen without seeds, and TNIK into a fine screen I had intended for ACVR1 with seeds. I only discovered this because I mass specced the TNIK just before setting up the plates, then rushed off to do them as it was the SGC Christmas party that night and I needed to finish (best not to rush experiments). When I checked the mass spec result later, I got the exact mass of ACVR1! So I went back to the crystallography room and recovered what protein I could from the source plate for the TNIK plates, and mass specced it again. Same result – ACVR1. But when I looked at the drop images for those plates (now containing ACVR1 + M4K3003), I found a bunch of crystals! Happy serendipity!! These will go on the trip to Diamond on the 21</span><sup>st</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> of January and then we’ll know whether the mistake really ended well or not.

<p>You may well ask, why was I setting up plates with TNIK? As it happens, some of our collaborators’ assays show M4K2009, our main compound of interest, hits both TNIK and DDR1 with pretty high affinity. We’ve been struggling to get crystals of ACVR1 with M4K2009 – for whatever reason, it doesn’t want to make crystals. So it seemed like a good idea to see if TNIK or DDR1 will co-crystallise with it. TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK Interacting Kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an activator of the Wnt signalling pathway. DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) is a tyrosine kinase that functions as cell surface receptor for fibrillar collagen and regulates cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, differentiation, survival and cell proliferation (according to its GeneCard).</p>
<p>While I was about it, I thought it would be useful to set up plates with BMPR1A (ALK3), for the same reason I set up TGFBR1 (ALK5) before – to see what off-target structures look like with some of these compounds. The purification protocols for TNIK and BMPR1A were as standard, but they’re available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo.</p>
<p>Some other good news is that I’ve figured out how to reproduce my XChem crystals fairly reliably. On the last day before the holidays I set up 6 plates of ACVR1 with M4K2117, which gives really beautiful, well-diffracting crystals. I used 10, 12 and 15 mg/ml protein, and made plates with and without seeds. Well, the ones without the seeds grew fabulously, within 2 weeks, and the ones with seeds didn’t! The next step with these then is to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. That&#8217;ll be for next week. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>I determined the potency of 24 new ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors synthesised by OICR. M4K2009 in particular is quite potent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50">larger values indicates lower potency</a>). This compound differs from legacy compound M4K1055 by the position of its methyl group (CH3) in the middle of the molecule. Attempts to replace the tri-methoxy group (the three CH3-O groups bonded to the phenyl ring) were not successful. Since a robust nanoBRET tracer is not available for TGFBR1/ALK5, I will use dual luciferase promoter assay (orthologous assay) to determine the off-target activity of these compounds towards TGFBR1/ALK5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! The last month of my life was taken over by making sure my PhD first year report was beautifully polished, but I have returned with results of a small compound screen:</p>
<p>These are all compounds that <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/jong-fu-wong/">Jong Fu</a> has already tested with his assays so we know they effectively inhibit ACVR1, but I thought it would be a good idea to try them out on my DIPG cells and see how well they can kill them. I included a few different variables in this screen to test what could make a difference to the outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tested cells grown in 2D and 3D because this has been noted to change the outcome of compound screens in other systems</li>
<li>I tested the compounds alone, or in addition to radiation in order to test whether the compounds were effective in addition to current DIPG treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested how effective each compound is by growing cells for 7 days in the presence of the compound. At the end I measured how alive or healthy the cells were (i.e. their viability) by using a pre-developed kit that measures the amount of ATP inside the cell by using an enzyme that can produce light when ATP is present. ATP is measured because this is sometimes called the &#8216;energy currency of the cell&#8217; so living cells have to have ATP inside them, whereas dead cells won&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be counted.</p>
<p>This screen produced a lot of data at once which is best visualised as heatmaps like these:</p>
<div id="attachment_2227" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2227" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png" alt="" width="780" height="929" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png 860w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-252x300.png 252w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-768x914.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ACVR1 inhibitor M4K2009 is best at reducing mutant ACVR1 DIPG cell viability, but is not effective in ACVR1 wild-type cells</strong><br />Heatmaps showing the viability (relative to an untreated control) of a 2D culture of mutant ACVR1 DIPG cells (A) or wild-type ACVR1 DIPG cells (B) following 7 days in the presence of 1μM of the indicated ALK2 inhibitors. The colour of each box indicates how viable the cells were at the end (where blue indicates an improvement in viability and red indicates a drop in viability). Each column indicates an individual (technical repeats, n1-3) grouped into those done at the same time (biological repeats 1-3).</p></div>
<p>From that heatmap you can see that M4K2009 is the best at killing ACVR1 mutant cells (the top heatmap), but it isn&#8217;t as effective in cells where the ACVR1 gene is not mutated (&#8220;wild-type&#8221; cells). In those cells instead M4K2096 is the most effective compound (but still not to the same extent as M4K2009).</p>
<p>But this is only the data for cells grown in 2 dimensions without a radiation treatment. If you want to see the full dataset, you can read my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2000673#.XAqo_FX7SUk">Zenodo post</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things have been really busy in the lab the last few weeks. I’ve done a couple of purifications of ACVR1 (ALK2), which I’ll post in <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1639900#.W_6-6Wj7SUk">Zenodo</a> (getting loads of protein now), but probably won’t write up the details of every purification every single time anymore, as it’s the same process every time for this construct. Please feel free to access earlier Zenodo posts for the protocol, or contact me and I’ll send you the links. I’ve also set up at least 50 crystal plates over the past month, most using the composite screen I made a while back, as well as follow up screens for hits in those conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven’t been lucky with other compounds again like I was with the big, beautiful M4K2117 crystals, but, after initial apparent abject failure to reproduce these, I now appear to have grown a plate of simply gorgeous beauties (about 40 wells with lovely crystals, which in theory should diffract around 1.5 Å or better) (see pics below, verified as protein with UV imaging). I’ve done this for the fragment screening side of the project, where we’re using x-ray crystallography to screen compound fragments in search of an allosteric binding site on ACVR1, as described in earlier posts. The crystal system I’ve been using is with LDN-193189 co-crystallised with ACVR1. The crystals are big and beautiful, but suffer from some issues: they give variable space groups, tricky for the pandda software to deal with, they have thick skins, which makes soaking somewhat variable and necessarily increases the soak time, as well as making mounting tricky. In many cases while mounting, I noticed the skin was formed almost as an envelope around the top and bottom of the drop, thus when you try to pull back the skin, it pulls the crystal with it and then wraps it up tightly in a big lump of sticky skin. I’m not that great at the micro-surgery needed to separate the mess out. Additionally, many of these crystals melt or become friable when soaked too long (more than ~2 hours).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The M4K2117 ACVR1 co-crystals however are in nice clear drops, although the conditions are very salty (0.1 M citrate pH 5.0 – 6.0, 1.4M ammonium sulphate, 0.2M sodium/potassium tartrate). This could be an issue for fragment binding – acidic conditions with lots of charged species around. Thus, I intend to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. Also, I need to figure out how to grow them reproducibly, as only those 40 wells from one plate out of 6 set up actually grew. It’s unclear why 2 other plates the same conditions and 3 other plates with essentially the same condition didn’t grow. Or perhaps I just need to wait a little longer (they take about a month to grow).  Many of the wells without crystals have a lot of phase separation, as shown in the pic below as well.</p>

I&#8217;m now refining the data and got some pretty good structures so far. These are what the current stats look like, below. There&#8217;s still some way to go with the refinement, but they look pretty good so far!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2129" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-1024x576.png" alt="" width="873" height="491" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also made some pretty pictures of the bound ligands, some or which were used for the M4K progress meeting yesterday. As can be seen below, the water molecule co-ordinating two of the Os on the trimethoxyphenyl is there, as in previous structures, and this is coordinated by another water and Lys235. The interaction of the hinge region of both ligands with His286 is also there. The solvent side is uncoordinated in the M4K2117 structure, but there&#8217;s a water there in M4K2121, which is less mobile in that region anyway, so that is not too surprising. It&#8217;s truly fabulous how we can easily see in these structures the chemical space that can still be explored to fill up the pocket, but I&#8217;m acutely aware of how many other important criteria a drug candidate has to fulfil in order to actually do its job properly. Hopefully, with the excellent expertise we have working on this project in all the different areas needed to make an effective drug, the structural information will be of use. Now, I have some more compounds to screen &#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the week has been super busy, but all for good reasons this time!! I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled to say that amongst all the salt crystals I found in my crystal plates, I also found the crystals below, one of which diffracted to 1.25 Å. This is definitely the highest resolution I&#8217;ve ever worked with. It&#8217;s amazing! You can see everything &#8211; as shown in the pic below, phenix found the ligand quite easily. This was with M4K2117. The other two datasets I got were at about 2 Å, also really good, and they&#8217;re for M4K2121. Clearly the use of the composite screen I set up has increased the hit rate, and allowed me to screen a lot more compounds more quickly and at both room temperature and 4 degrees.</p>
<p>The link to the autoprocessed .mtz files is <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1475852#.W9mR4JP7SUk">here.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already set up 20 more plates with 10 more compounds &#8211; fingers crossed we get more crystals and more data! A brilliant end to a tough few weeks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in my last post, I got 26 mg of ACVR1 on my last purification (as shown in my Zenodo log <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1446500#.W7djZWhKiUk">here</a>). This is fabulous as it has allowed me to follow up a number of conditions for crystallisation. In particular, one of these hits was in G10 of my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7dkR2hKiUk">composite screen</a>. I&#8217;ve therefore set up a lot of plates around this condition, and at the same time have mounted some of the crystals that were in those wells with different compounds, and will be screening them at the synchrotron tonight. The best outcome of course would be a dataset, but at least if they diffract ok I know I have something to work with, as the fine screens are showing some small, needly crystals which could probably be optimised a bit.</p>
<p>Wish me luck, and I&#8217;ll hopefully update on Monday!</p>
