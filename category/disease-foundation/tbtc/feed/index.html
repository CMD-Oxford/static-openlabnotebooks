				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further down the line I want to be able to test the activation of the BMP signalling pathway downstream of the ALK2 receptor. For this I plan to use the alkaline phosphatase gene as a readout &#8211; it&#8217;s a well known gene activated downstream of BMP signalling so a lot of easy to use assays already exist for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/optimising-an-assay-to-detect-alkaline-phosphatase-activity-in-c2c12-cells/">when I tested this assay with the standard C2C12 cell line it didn&#8217;t work particularly well</a> so I&#8217;ve decided to try again with a new set of cells. This time I&#8217;m choosing connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) from FOP patients as a reporter cell line because they respond more strongly to the signals that activate the BMP pathway (called BMP ligands).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never worked with these cells before so, again, I needed to work out how many I&#8217;ll need to get a good result from the assay. These cells however grow as a very thin sheet which is so see-through that I initially couldn&#8217;t tell if the wells were full. To solve this I used stains called Calcein AM and Hoechst. Calcein AM can stain any living cell because they metabolise it from a see-through molecule into a fluorescent green product, whereas Hoechst can stick to DNA and turn all the cell nuclei blue, and so suddenly, all of my cells glow:</p>
<div id="attachment_2389" style="width: 1382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png"><img class="wp-image-2389 size-full" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png" alt="Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)" width="1372" height="784" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png 1372w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-300x171.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-768x439.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)</p></div>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they pretty?</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re this easy to see, it&#8217;s even easier to see how many cells are needed to fill a well, but not get overcrowded. You can read more about how I did that in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2546911">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The only question I have left is why some cells didn&#8217;t stain with Calcein AM, even though their nucleus looks fine? Anyone know the answer?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone and happy New Year! I really, really wanted to end the year on a high note in December before I went off on holiday, but as it turned out, I didn’t have enough time to set up 18 plates and write a blog post on the last day. So I’ll just have to start the year on a high note.</p>
<p>I’m very happy to say I got another ACVR1/ALK2 structure in December, at 2 Å resolution, co-crystallised with M4K2158 (see images below, and the .mtz autoprocessed file is available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo). The structure is not fully refined yet, but what’s interesting is the solvent side of the molecule is being stabilised by either a water contact (Chain A) or Asp293 (Chain B). This gives it really good density.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2367" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2367 " src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png" alt="" width="855" height="481" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 bound to M4K2158 at ~2 Å, showing interactions with His286 and a water at the back of the pocket</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also seem to have some new <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">pretty </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">hits with M4K2118, M4K2149 and M4K3003 (crystal pics below). What’s interesting about the M4K3003 hits is that I’ve really struggled to get crystals with this compound (as well as M4K3007 and 3010), and it is a pretty desirable structure. These hits came about as a result of a mistake, where I somehow managed to mix up my tubes and put ACVR1 with M4K3003 into my mega composite screen without seeds, and TNIK into a fine screen I had intended for ACVR1 with seeds. I only discovered this because I mass specced the TNIK just before setting up the plates, then rushed off to do them as it was the SGC Christmas party that night and I needed to finish (best not to rush experiments). When I checked the mass spec result later, I got the exact mass of ACVR1! So I went back to the crystallography room and recovered what protein I could from the source plate for the TNIK plates, and mass specced it again. Same result – ACVR1. But when I looked at the drop images for those plates (now containing ACVR1 + M4K3003), I found a bunch of crystals! Happy serendipity!! These will go on the trip to Diamond on the 21</span><sup>st</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> of January and then we’ll know whether the mistake really ended well or not. Fingers crossed!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2366" style="width: 893px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2366" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 co-crystallised with M4K2149, 2118 and 3003 &#8211; hits to send to the synchrotron</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may well ask, why was I setting up plates with TNIK? As it happens, some of our collaborators’ assays show M4K2009, our main compound of interest, hits both TNIK and DDR1 with pretty high affinity. We’ve been struggling to get crystals of ACVR1 with M4K2009 – for whatever reason, it doesn’t want to make crystals. So it seemed like a good idea to see if TNIK or DDR1 will co-crystallise with it. TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK Interacting Kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an activator of the Wnt signalling pathway. DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) is a tyrosine kinase that functions as cell surface receptor for fibrillar collagen and regulates cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, differentiation, survival and cell proliferation (according to its GeneCard).</p>
<p>While I was about it, I thought it would be useful to set up plates with BMPR1A (ALK3), for the same reason I set up TGFBR1 (ALK5) before – to see what off-target structures look like with some of these compounds. The purification protocols for TNIK and BMPR1A were as standard, but they’re available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo.</p>
<p>Some other good news is that I’ve figured out how to reproduce my XChem crystals fairly reliably. On the last day before the holidays I set up 6 plates of ACVR1 with M4K2117, which gives really beautiful, well-diffracting crystals. I used 10, 12 and 15 mg/ml protein, and made plates with and without seeds. Well, the ones without the seeds grew fabulously, within 2 weeks, and the ones with seeds didn’t! The next step with these then is to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. That&#8217;ll be for next week. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>I determined the potency of 24 new ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors synthesised by OICR. M4K2009 in particular is quite potent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50">larger values indicates lower potency</a>). This compound differs from legacy compound M4K1055 by the position of its methyl group (CH3) in the middle of the molecule. Attempts to replace the tri-methoxy group (the three CH3-O groups bonded to the phenyl ring) were not successful. Since a robust nanoBRET tracer is not available for TGFBR1/ALK5, I will use dual luciferase promoter assay (orthologous assay) to determine the off-target activity of these compounds towards TGFBR1/ALK5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! The last month of my life was taken over by making sure my PhD first year report was beautifully polished, but I have returned with results of a small compound screen:</p>
<p>These are all compounds that <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/category/scientist/jong-fu-wong/">Jong Fu</a> has already tested with his assays so we know they effectively inhibit ACVR1, but I thought it would be a good idea to try them out on my DIPG cells and see how well they can kill them. I included a few different variables in this screen to test what could make a difference to the outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tested cells grown in 2D and 3D because this has been noted to change the outcome of compound screens in other systems</li>
<li>I tested the compounds alone, or in addition to radiation in order to test whether the compounds were effective in addition to current DIPG treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested how effective each compound is by growing cells for 7 days in the presence of the compound. At the end I measured how alive or healthy the cells were (i.e. their viability) by using a pre-developed kit that measures the amount of ATP inside the cell by using an enzyme that can produce light when ATP is present. ATP is measured because this is sometimes called the &#8216;energy currency of the cell&#8217; so living cells have to have ATP inside them, whereas dead cells won&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be counted.</p>
<p>This screen produced a lot of data at once which is best visualised as heatmaps like these:</p>
<div id="attachment_2227" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2227" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png" alt="" width="780" height="929" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png 860w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-252x300.png 252w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-768x914.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ACVR1 inhibitor M4K2009 is best at reducing mutant ACVR1 DIPG cell viability, but is not effective in ACVR1 wild-type cells</strong><br />Heatmaps showing the viability (relative to an untreated control) of a 2D culture of mutant ACVR1 DIPG cells (A) or wild-type ACVR1 DIPG cells (B) following 7 days in the presence of 1μM of the indicated ALK2 inhibitors. The colour of each box indicates how viable the cells were at the end (where blue indicates an improvement in viability and red indicates a drop in viability). Each column indicates an individual (technical repeats, n1-3) grouped into those done at the same time (biological repeats 1-3).</p></div>
<p>From that heatmap you can see that M4K2009 is the best at killing ACVR1 mutant cells (the top heatmap), but it isn&#8217;t as effective in cells where the ACVR1 gene is not mutated (&#8220;wild-type&#8221; cells). In those cells instead M4K2096 is the most effective compound (but still not to the same extent as M4K2009).</p>
<p>But this is only the data for cells grown in 2 dimensions without a radiation treatment. If you want to see the full dataset, you can read my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2000673#.XAqo_FX7SUk">Zenodo post</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things have been really busy in the lab the last few weeks. I’ve done a couple of purifications of ACVR1 (ALK2), which I’ll post in <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1639900#.W_6-6Wj7SUk">Zenodo</a> (getting loads of protein now), but probably won’t write up the details of every purification every single time anymore, as it’s the same process every time for this construct. Please feel free to access earlier Zenodo posts for the protocol, or contact me and I’ll send you the links. I’ve also set up at least 50 crystal plates over the past month, most using the composite screen I made a while back, as well as follow up screens for hits in those conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven’t been lucky with other compounds again like I was with the big, beautiful M4K2117 crystals, but, after initial apparent abject failure to reproduce these, I now appear to have grown a plate of simply gorgeous beauties (about 40 wells with lovely crystals, which in theory should diffract around 1.5 Å or better) (see pics below, verified as protein with UV imaging). I’ve done this for the fragment screening side of the project, where we’re using x-ray crystallography to screen compound fragments in search of an allosteric binding site on ACVR1, as described in earlier posts. The crystal system I’ve been using is with LDN-193189 co-crystallised with ACVR1. The crystals are big and beautiful, but suffer from some issues: they give variable space groups, tricky for the pandda software to deal with, they have thick skins, which makes soaking somewhat variable and necessarily increases the soak time, as well as making mounting tricky. In many cases while mounting, I noticed the skin was formed almost as an envelope around the top and bottom of the drop, thus when you try to pull back the skin, it pulls the crystal with it and then wraps it up tightly in a big lump of sticky skin. I’m not that great at the micro-surgery needed to separate the mess out. Additionally, many of these crystals melt or become friable when soaked too long (more than ~2 hours).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The M4K2117 ACVR1 co-crystals however are in nice clear drops, although the conditions are very salty (0.1 M citrate pH 5.0 – 6.0, 1.4M ammonium sulphate, 0.2M sodium/potassium tartrate). This could be an issue for fragment binding – acidic conditions with lots of charged species around. Thus, I intend to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. Also, I need to figure out how to grow them reproducibly, as only those 40 wells from one plate out of 6 set up actually grew. It’s unclear why 2 other plates the same conditions and 3 other plates with essentially the same condition didn’t grow. Or perhaps I just need to wait a little longer (they take about a month to grow).  Many of the wells without crystals have a lot of phase separation, as shown in the pic below as well.</p>

I&#8217;m now refining the data and got some pretty good structures so far. These are what the current stats look like, below. There&#8217;s still some way to go with the refinement, but they look pretty good so far!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2129" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-1024x576.png" alt="" width="873" height="491" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also made some pretty pictures of the bound ligands, some or which were used for the M4K progress meeting yesterday. As can be seen below, the water molecule co-ordinating two of the Os on the trimethoxyphenyl is there, as in previous structures, and this is coordinated by another water and Lys235. The interaction of the hinge region of both ligands with His286 is also there. The solvent side is uncoordinated in the M4K2117 structure, but there&#8217;s a water there in M4K2121, which is less mobile in that region anyway, so that is not too surprising. It&#8217;s truly fabulous how we can easily see in these structures the chemical space that can still be explored to fill up the pocket, but I&#8217;m acutely aware of how many other important criteria a drug candidate has to fulfil in order to actually do its job properly. Hopefully, with the excellent expertise we have working on this project in all the different areas needed to make an effective drug, the structural information will be of use. Now, I have some more compounds to screen &#8230;</p>

I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled to say that amongst all the salt crystals I found in my crystal plates, I also found the crystals below, one of which diffracted to 1.25 Å. This is definitely the highest resolution I&#8217;ve ever worked with. It&#8217;s amazing! You can see everything &#8211; as shown in the pic below, phenix found the ligand quite easily. This was with M4K2117. The other two datasets I got were at about 2 Å, also really good, and they&#8217;re for M4K2121. Clearly the use of the composite screen I set up has increased the hit rate, and allowed me to screen a lot more compounds more quickly and at both room temperature and 4 degrees.</p>
<p>The link to the autoprocessed .mtz files is <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1475852#.W9mR4JP7SUk">here.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already set up 20 more plates with 10 more compounds &#8211; fingers crossed we get more crystals and more data! A brilliant end to a tough few weeks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in my last post, I got 26 mg of ACVR1 on my last purification (as shown in my Zenodo log <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1446500#.W7djZWhKiUk">here</a>).

In particular, one of these hits was in G10 of my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7dkR2hKiUk">composite screen</a>. I&#8217;ve therefore set up a lot of plates around this condition, and at the same time have mounted some of the crystals that were in those wells with different compounds, and will be screening them at the synchrotron tonight. The best outcome of course would be a dataset, but at least if they diffract ok I know I have something to work with, as the fine screens are showing some small, needly crystals which could probably be optimised a bit.</p>
<p>Wish me luck, and I&#8217;ll hopefully update on Monday!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that our workhorse ACVR1 construct is expressing again, I’m getting loads of protein – 26 mg on the last 3 L scale up! Because of this, I’ve been really busy in the lab trying to get things back up to speed again. While waiting for the ACVR1 to work, I purified some TGFBR1 (ALK5) for co-crystallisation with some of the less ALK2-specific compounds M4K has been providing us with. The protocol notes for that are <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7TDQGhKiUk">here</a>, but unfortunately, neither the short nor long constructs of TGFBR1 has provided us with any usable crystals so far, despite setting up many, many plates. If possible, I will farm some of the plates for seeds, but the reality is there was not much crystalline material in my TGFBR1 plates.</p>
<p>I also spent some time (and gained a few more grey hairs) designing and making a big composite screen of all our other coarse screens (5 in total). We are aware that screening a lot of compounds at two different temperatures in 5 screens, and then following up on hits from those screens is time and protein-intensive. We decided to make things a little more streamlined and efficient by looking at the conditions that ACVR1 typically crystallises in. Analysis of the 13 structures of ACVR1 in the PDB showed that most of them grew in conditions containing phosphate, citrate or sulphate. Thus, I pulled out all the phosphate, citrate and sulphate conditions in JCSG7, LFS6, HIN3, HCS3 and BCS6 and combined them all into one big 96-well coarse screen. The components of the screen are all in the Zenodo post <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7TDQGhKiUk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since I had a lot of fresh new ACVR1 – the purification protocol is <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7TDQGhKiUk">here</a> – I set up 10 compounds at two different temperatures with this new screen, and got loads of hits (images below). Unfortunately, after UV imaging the plates, I discovered that all the big, beautiful, fabulous looking crystals I had picked in the ammonium phosphate/acetate condition, were salt. Crushing disappointment! So today I’ve made 3 more fine screens based on the ugly, needly, micro, spherulite-like hits I had in other conditions, that are in fact protein. I’ll document these screens tomorrow. With a huge dose of luck, I will have some prettier crystals by tomorrow morning, in time to mount them and send them to the synchrotron for our trip Friday evening. In the meantime, I’ll try to mount some of the less ugly ones from the coarse screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Structure Solution for BMPR1B/FKBP12 complex bound to M4K2009.</p>
<p>Good news everybody!</p>
<p>From the crystals I sent to the Diamond Light Source (a synchrotron, or particle accelerator, that gives very high quality x-rays) last week, I got a data set for BMPR1B/FKBP12 with M4K2009 bound to it! This is one of the compounds that the M4K Pharma company is very keen to see in situ to understand it&#8217;s action. While it would ideally be bound to ALK2 (something Ros is working on), seeing it bound to BMPR1B is also useful for understanding it&#8217;s selectivity (or lack of it) across various BMP signalling proteins.</p>
<p>The data looks like it refines down to around 2.34 Å. I’ve then spent much of last week analysing the data and trying to get a decent model of the proteins.</p>
<p>The data is in the P1 21 1 crystal form (this is just a way of describing the symmetry within the crystal) and has two copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit (which is another way of defining how the protein is packed inside the crystal). It’s refining nicely and I’ve got a very nice clear look at the compound bound to the binding site however I also noticed that several (but not all) exposed cysteines have been covalently modified by something in the plate well condition to give very distinct blobs of electron density that need to be identified.</p>

<p><em>Compound M4K2009 bound to BMPR1B.</em></p>
<p>Looking back, the crystal was grown in 20% PEG8000, 0.2M Magnesium Acetate and 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5.  Under these conditions it’s most likely that the cacodylate has reacted with the cys residue, most likely catalysed by neighbouring side chains deprotonating the SH group and allowing it to react with the arsenic at the centre of Cacodylate. However, there are two possible reactions that could occur, one of which leaves you with a sulphur bound to an arsenic with two methyl groups and an oxygen attached to it, and the other which leaves you with just two methyl groups bound to the arsenic. Now – consulting with my chemist colleagues they believe that the oxygen containing result is most likely and I’m inclined to agree as it is the simplest and most easily catalysed reaction. However, looking at the density and modelling in both options, it looks like the second might fit better. Either there is a more complex reaction occurring or it’s possible the oxygen has been knocked off by radiation damage during data collection.</p>
<p>Currently I’ve modeled them all as the second option since as a general rule what the data is telling you should win out over the prediction, but I can relatively easily change that if necessary. I need to get a second opinion on it at some point and any thoughts are greatly received.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1949" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cacodylate_modification.png" alt="" width="311" height="125" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cacodylate_modification.png 311w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cacodylate_modification-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /></p>
<p><em>Two possible options of cacodylate modification to cys residues.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, none of the cys residues are near the binding site however so this isn’t an issue that is going to effect that result and I can be fairly confident that compound binding is not influenced by it.</p>
