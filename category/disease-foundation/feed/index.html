				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello fellow scientists and open lab notebook readers!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m Carolyn Marks and I’m working in the ALS-RAP partnership with <a href="https://thesgc.org/profile/karolinska/sgraslund">Susanne Gräslund</a>, who leads the Recombinant Antibodies Group at <a href="https://www.thesgc.org/karolinska">SGC-Karolinska</a> in Stockholm, Sweden. SGC-Karolinska has had a long-standing collaboration with <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/human-antibody-therapeutics/">Helena Persson Lotsholm</a>, Director of the Human Antibody Therapeutics Facility within the <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/platforms/ddd">Drug Discovery and Development Platform at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm</a>. I am fortunate to work with and learn from several experts to generate the highest quality antibodies for the ALS-Reproducible Antibody Platform. I joined the <a href="https://www.als-rap.org/team">ALS-RAP team</a> in September of last year and from here on out I’ll be sharing live updates of our work with this community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps I should tell you a little bit about me, what we do at SGC-Karolinska, and how I got here. I’m a wet lab kind of gal and a neuroscientist at heart with a lot of years of experience under my belt. The methods that I use here at SGC-Karolinska for the ALS-RAP are broad and range from phage display technology to cloning to high-throughput screening to patient-derived cell-based assays. Actually, many of the methods that I&#8217;m using now to generate and validate recombinant antibodies for the ALS-RAP, I used for many years to study neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I´m originally from Texas where my love of neurophysiology began, and where I was initially trained as an electrophysiologist. From there, I deferred medical school and took an internship at NINDS at the NIH to have a break before med school began. My 1-year internship turned into two, and I quickly understood why everyone at NIH kept telling me “Carolyn, you reek of a PhD!” I soon found the NIH-Karolinska Graduate Partnerships Program and hopped on a plane. That&#8217;s how the girl from Texas ended up in Sweden. I received my PhD in 2012 from the NIH-Karolinska Collaborative Doctoral Program in Neuroscience; and I recently completed my Post-Doc, also at Karolinska, characterizing the ubiquitin proteasome system as therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How did I find my way to the SGC, you might wonder? In my research over the years, I have experienced first-hand the need for reliable high-quality antibodies – and the lack thereof, as well. I hate that we as scientists are limited by the tools that companies provide. These limitations are crippling our research. Sadly, the ones who suffer the most are the patients. This was my motivation for joining SGC-Karolinska and particularly this project. I wanted to make better tools for the research community. Consequently, I believe that better research tools will yield better science and hopefully better therapeutics for the patients who need it. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How does the <a href="https://www.als-rap.org/overview">ALS-RAP</a> work? Our team at Karolinska is only 1 of many. We work together primarily with scientists at <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/introducing-the-team-the-gileadi-group-in-oxford/">Oxford</a> and in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/research/researchers/thomas-m-durcan-phd">Montreal</a>. The ALS-RAP was created by three major ALS charities from Canada, the UK, and the US. The long-term goal of this partnership is to provide the ALS research community with reproducible, thoroughly validated antibodies for selected ALS-related proteins. This includes testing existing commercial antibodies as well as generating new ones. The work is done in three different labs, as recently outlined by my fellow ALS-RAP partner and open-lab-notebooker, <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/validated-antibodies-for-als-research-the-als-rap-project/">Opher Gileadi</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Stockholm team, we use phage display technology to create recombinant antibodies. Don´t know what phage display is? The inventors of this technique were actually awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/summary/">Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018</a>. While this technology has many uses, we use phage display to generate recombinant antibodies. How does it work you might wonder? When we receive antigens of our ALS proteins from our friends in <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/opher-gileadi">Oxford</a>, we then use the phage display technique to select out antibodies that binds these antigens. We use extensive libraries of human antibody candidates where high-quality binders can be obtained with the phage display method. We then perform several rounds of screening and selection to ensure that we get the best possible antibodies. We then evaluate their specificity and affinity and finally we validate the antibodies using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. It sounds simple, but trust me it’s a thorough process! Last but not least, we will release the sequence of the best antibody for each target on our website and make it available to anyone who wants to use it. Our collaborators in Montreal are creating CRISPR-knockouts of these targets in both standard cell lines and iPSCs for further validation and application specificity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have a really exciting <a href="https://als-rap.org/target-list">target list</a>, built by the help of our ALS-RAP advisory board. Check it out and see if your favorite protein or that much needed antibody is on our list. If not, click <a href="https://als-rap.org/your-input">here</a> and request it. So far, we have generated and selected our first set of antibodies for 7 of these targets. Now onto primary and secondary validation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay tuned to find out who the lucky 7 are…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further down the line I want to be able to test the activation of the BMP signalling pathway downstream of the ALK2 receptor. For this I plan to use the alkaline phosphatase gene as a readout &#8211; it&#8217;s a well known gene activated downstream of BMP signalling so a lot of easy to use assays already exist for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/optimising-an-assay-to-detect-alkaline-phosphatase-activity-in-c2c12-cells/">when I tested this assay with the standard C2C12 cell line it didn&#8217;t work particularly well</a> so I&#8217;ve decided to try again with a new set of cells. This time I&#8217;m choosing connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) from FOP patients as a reporter cell line because they respond more strongly to the signals that activate the BMP pathway (called BMP ligands).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never worked with these cells before so, again, I needed to work out how many I&#8217;ll need to get a good result from the assay. These cells however grow as a very thin sheet which is so see-through that I initially couldn&#8217;t tell if the wells were full. To solve this I used stains called Calcein AM and Hoechst. Calcein AM can stain any living cell because they metabolise it from a see-through molecule into a fluorescent green product, whereas Hoechst can stick to DNA and turn all the cell nuclei blue, and so suddenly, all of my cells glow:</p>
<div id="attachment_2389" style="width: 1382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png"><img class="wp-image-2389 size-full" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png" alt="Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)" width="1372" height="784" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png 1372w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-300x171.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-768x439.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)</p></div>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they pretty?</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re this easy to see, it&#8217;s even easier to see how many cells are needed to fill a well, but not get overcrowded. You can read more about how I did that in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2546911">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The only question I have left is why some cells didn&#8217;t stain with Calcein AM, even though their nucleus looks fine? Anyone know the answer?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The experimental set-up and results covered in this post can be found here: <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2541053">10.5281/zenodo.2541053</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot has happened in the past few months and it is with mixed feelings that I am finishing up my postdoc here at SGC! I feel very privileged to have been part of the great science going on at SGC and a pioneer of the Open Notebook initiative here, contributing to open science. Nonetheless, the science has to go on! Hopefully, my posts in this Open Notebook have provided new perspectives to people working on similar projects and trying to learn more about Huntington’s Disease and huntingtin (HTT), inspired people to strive on for science despite the negative and/or inconclusive data, or at least given some insight to how life on the bench is like in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously, I showed that the use of PRMT5 inhibitors from the SGC probe library, namely GSK591 and LLY283, were able to decrease levels of HTT in HeLa cells. SGC2096, the inactive control to GSK591, was not able to decrease HTT protein levels. This, together with the different mechanisms of action of GSK591 and LLY283 in inhibiting PRMT5, demonstrates that it is indeed through the specific inhibition of PRMT5 that HTT protein levels were decreased. So far, I have not come across any drug that is able to regulate the levels of HTT protein. As such, the inhibition of PRMT5 to reduce the expression of HTT at the protein level presents a potential and exciting therapeutic avenue for the treatment of Huntington’s disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The findings that PRMT5 inhibition itself can affect the expression of HTT at the protein level suggests that there might be some interaction and possible feedback loop in play between PRMT5 and HTT. We thus further investigated how PRMT5 inhibition may contribute to the decrease in HTT protein levels to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process. As PRMT5 is the main enzyme known to mediate symmetric demethylation of arginine (SDMA), we thus checked how the levels of SDMA are affected by PRMT5 inhibition and HTT knockdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2379" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="578" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD-300x225.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD-768x576.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD-350x263.jpg 350w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD-780x586.jpg 780w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD-250x188.jpg 250w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HeLa-G3BP1-PRMT5i-in-HTT-KD.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, PRMT5 inhibition with GSK591 or LLY283 led to the decrease in SDMA. However, we also noticed a slight decrease in SDMA across all 3 HTT knockdown samples! Although this decrease is marginal, its occurrence across all the HTT knockdown samples we tested gives confidence to this observation and corroborates the hypothesis that PRMT5 and HTT are part of a feedback loop rather than that HTT is simply downstream of PRMT5, since the inhibition of PRMT5 leads to a decrease in HTT, and a decrease in HTT by way of HTT knockdown leads to a decrease in SDMA, which is mainly mediated by PRMT5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two-way crosstalk demonstrated by PRMT5 activity levels affecting the expression of HTT and the presence (or absence, since we used a knockdown model) of HTT likewise decreasing SDMA levels suggests that the relationship between PRMT5 and HTT is complicated and reciprocal, with one regulating the other possibly through post-translational modifications such as SDMA and other epigenetic mechanisms, and warrants further investigation as to how the activity and levels of PRMT5 and HTT are related. Some important future experiments would be to test if PRMT inhibition is also able to decrease the protein levels of mutant HTT similarly to how it affects wild-type HTT, and if so, this will be an exciting opportunity to follow up on in the search of a potential therapy for Huntington’s disease.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone and happy New Year! I really, really wanted to end the year on a high note in December before I went off on holiday, but as it turned out, I didn’t have enough time to set up 18 plates and write a blog post on the last day. So I’ll just have to start the year on a high note.</p>
<p>I’m very happy to say I got another ACVR1/ALK2 structure in December, at 2 Å resolution, co-crystallised with M4K2158 (see images below, and the .mtz autoprocessed file is available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo). The structure is not fully refined yet, but what’s interesting is the solvent side of the molecule is being stabilised by either a water contact (Chain A) or Asp293 (Chain B). This gives it really good density.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2367" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2367 " src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png" alt="" width="855" height="481" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 bound to M4K2158 at ~2 Å, showing interactions with His286 and a water at the back of the pocket</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also seem to have some new <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">pretty </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">hits with M4K2118, M4K2149 and M4K3003 (crystal pics below). What’s interesting about the M4K3003 hits is that I’ve really struggled to get crystals with this compound (as well as M4K3007 and 3010), and it is a pretty desirable structure. These hits came about as a result of a mistake, where I somehow managed to mix up my tubes and put ACVR1 with M4K3003 into my mega composite screen without seeds, and TNIK into a fine screen I had intended for ACVR1 with seeds. I only discovered this because I mass specced the TNIK just before setting up the plates, then rushed off to do them as it was the SGC Christmas party that night and I needed to finish (best not to rush experiments). When I checked the mass spec result later, I got the exact mass of ACVR1! So I went back to the crystallography room and recovered what protein I could from the source plate for the TNIK plates, and mass specced it again. Same result – ACVR1. But when I looked at the drop images for those plates (now containing ACVR1 + M4K3003), I found a bunch of crystals! Happy serendipity!! These will go on the trip to Diamond on the 21</span><sup>st</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> of January and then we’ll know whether the mistake really ended well or not. Fingers crossed!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2366" style="width: 893px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2366" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 co-crystallised with M4K2149, 2118 and 3003 &#8211; hits to send to the synchrotron</p></div>

<p>You may well ask, why was I setting up plates with TNIK? As it happens, some of our collaborators’ assays show M4K2009, our main compound of interest, hits both TNIK and DDR1 with pretty high affinity. We’ve been struggling to get crystals of ACVR1 with M4K2009 – for whatever reason, it doesn’t want to make crystals. So it seemed like a good idea to see if TNIK or DDR1 will co-crystallise with it. TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK Interacting Kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an activator of the Wnt signalling pathway. DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) is a tyrosine kinase that functions as cell surface receptor for fibrillar collagen and regulates cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, differentiation, survival and cell proliferation (according to its GeneCard).</p>
<p>While I was about it, I thought it would be useful to set up plates with BMPR1A (ALK3), for the same reason I set up TGFBR1 (ALK5) before – to see what off-target structures look like with some of these compounds. The purification protocols for TNIK and BMPR1A were as standard, but they’re available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo.</p>
<p>Some other good news is that I’ve figured out how to reproduce my XChem crystals fairly reliably. On the last day before the holidays I set up 6 plates of ACVR1 with M4K2117, which gives really beautiful, well-diffracting crystals. I used 10, 12 and 15 mg/ml protein, and made plates with and without seeds. Well, the ones without the seeds grew fabulously, within 2 weeks, and the ones with seeds didn’t! The next step with these then is to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. That&#8217;ll be for next week. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>I determined the potency of 24 new ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors synthesised by OICR. M4K2009 in particular is quite potent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50">larger values indicates lower potency</a>).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again! A few posts ago, when I shared my fragment screening results (<a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/analysis-of-fragments-that-bind-to-hao1/">here</a>), I mentioned that we had one fragment that bound at the interface between two subunits of the HAO1 tetramer (figure 1 will refresh your memory). The simplest way to turn this into an inhibitor would be to make it bigger so that it disrupts or otherwise changes the HAO1 tetramer. This could inhibit HAO1 activity either directly, where compound-induced changes in the amount, shape or flexibility of the tetramer reduce HAO1 efficiency (<strong>less HAO1 activity</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">), or indirectly, where disrupting the tetramer reduces the stability of HAO1 protein (<strong>less HAO1 amount</strong>).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2282" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/post7-fig1-1024x572.png" alt="" width="780" height="436" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/post7-fig1-1024x572.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/post7-fig1-300x168.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/post7-fig1-768x429.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/post7-fig1.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Figure 1: Fragment 6 binds at the interface between two subunits of the HAO1 tetramer. </strong>A. Location of fragment binding in relation to the HAO1 tetramer. B. Surface model showing fragment binds in pocket between two subunits. C. Ribbon and stick model showing fragment 6 interacts with both subunits, displacing R341 (subunit 1) and pi stacking with Y163 (subunit 2).</em></p>
<p>So, with help from Tamas Szommer in Paul Brennan’s group (check out the group page <a href="https://www.brennanresearchgroup.com/">here</a>), I made a small set of fifteen bigger compounds to see if we can develop inhibitors targeting the subunit interface. I wanted to preserve the aromatic ring (called a pyrimidine because of its two nitrogen groups), which engages in pi stacking with one subunit of HAO1, and the chlorine substituent, which displaces an arginine on the other subunit, to try to ensure that the compounds still bind to the same place, while replacing the five-membered, oxygen-containing ring (called a tetrahydrofuran) with larger substituents.</p>
<p>To do this I used a common chemical reaction, called <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Textbook_Maps/Organic_Chemistry/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_(McMurry)/Chapter_16%3A_Chemistry_of_Benzene_-_Electrophilic_Aromatic_Substitution/16.07_Nucleophilic_Aromatic_Substitution">nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a>, to replace one chlorine in a dichloro-pyrimidine with the amine (-NH) group of various building blocks. In this reaction (shown in figure 2A), a nucleophilic group (in this case the amine of the building block, R1-NH-R2) is added to an aromatic ring, delocalising the electrons and forming an intermediate known as the Meisenheimer complex. Then, the halogen atom (in this case the second chlorine) is eliminated from the ring, allowing it to return to its preferred, lower energy, aromatic conformation. I chose 15 compounds that were diverse in structure and greater than 150 Daltons in size (a tetrahydrofuran is 72 Daltons) to be my building blocks (figure 2B).</p>

Inset: Meisenheimer complex intermediate. B. 15 building blocks selected based on size, diversity and inclusion of a free amine (NH or NH2).</em></p>
<p>As with the loop 4 and active site follow up compounds (discussed in my <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/screening-follow-up-compounds-from-active-site-and-gating-loop-hao1-fragment-hits/">last post</a>), I tested my new compounds for inhibition of HAO1 using a fluorescence-based activity assay. Of the 15 compounds, only three inhibited more than 50% of HAO1 activity at 1 mM, allowing me to determine an IC50 for them. The best compound, SM001-10, has an IC50 of 86 μM. Some compounds showed no inhibition at all at 1 mM and this is also useful in determining how (and how not) to expand the good compounds. More details about the synthesis and testing of these compounds can be found on my Zenodo post <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2341173">here</a>.</p>

<p>We need two more pieces of information to guide the development of these compound into good inhibitors for HAO1: x-ray crystal structures to tell us how exactly the compounds bind and where we could grow the compounds to improve them; and an assay that tells us more about <em>how</em> these compounds are inhibiting HAO1 activity i.e. do they disrupt the HAO1 tetramer? Or change the shape of the tetramer so that it is less effective at turning over the substrate?</p>
<p>Well, with any luck, we will find out together in the New Year! Until then – Happy holidays everyone!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One problem with working with the isolated kinase domains of ALK2 and it’s type II binding partners, is that the affinity between the kinase domains alone is insufficient to allow complex formation. We know that the two proteins associate with each other in vivo and are co-localised by the domains on the outside of the membrane. However when we just mix the two kinase domains we don’t see a strong enough association to allow a complex to be purified. We know from in-vitro tests such as the phosphorylation tests I’ve mentioned previously that there must at least be transient contact to allow phosphorylation but that isn’t sufficient to set up crystal plates of the complex.</p>
<p>One way to try and get around this is to artificially tether the two kinase domains together with a flexible loop. I have a construct which does exactly this, tethering one end of ACVR2 to ALK2. It’s known as QQ02ACVR2A. I purified this protein and then formed a complex with the binding partner FKBP12 which will bind to the GS domain of ALK2 present in the construct.</p>
<p>The first test during purification was to see if a complex could be assembled between the fusion construct and FKBP12. As they are very differences sizes (72 kDa vs. 12 kDa) purification by gel filtration gives a very clear answer. We can clearly see co-elution of the fusion and FKBP12 which is only possible if they were present as a complex. This in its self is quite exciting as it shows the fusion is still able to bind to its physiological binding partner.</p>
<p>The second stage after purification is to attempt to crystallise the complex. I concentrated the purified protein down and added compound K02288. K02288 definitely binds ALK2 and has some affinity for ACVR2 which is necessary for stabilising both kinase domains sufficiently to crystallise. I’ve tried crystallising ALK2 alone without compound before and had zero success so it was important to add a compound to this crystallisation attempt.</p>
<p>I set up four coarse screen plates and got the following in the HCS screen:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2262" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/initial_crystals-300x286.png" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/initial_crystals-300x286.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/initial_crystals.png 598w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>B6: 20% PEG8000, 0.2M Mg Acetate, 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5</p>
<p>A7: 1.4M Na Acetate, 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5</p>
<p>A8: 30% 2-propanol, 0.2M Na Citrate tribasic, 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5</p>
<p>These are crystalline but not crystals so I designed a follow up screen based around these conditions. I then used what was left of my complex to set up two plates in this followup screen at 4C and 20C.</p>
<p>After 7 days I found the following in my plates:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2263" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-1024x633.png" alt="" width="780" height="482" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-1024x633.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-300x185.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-768x475.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>I mounted five examples and sent them to the synchrotron. Alas they all came back as either salt or no diffraction. While the salt must be ignored, it’s possible that the no diffraction crystals are protein but just do not diffract. The next step will be to make seed stocks from these wells, purify more protein and set up some more plates to see if I can get any better crystals.</p>
<p>You can find more details <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2276755">over at Zenodo.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m off for Christmas the middle of next week but in the new year I&#8217;ll be trying again at crystallising a variety of different proteins and compounds as well as working on characterising the phospho-mutants of ALK2 I posted about last time. Have a great holiday!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! The last month of my life was taken over by making sure my PhD first year report was beautifully polished, but I have returned with results of a small compound screen:</p>
<p>These are all compounds that <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/category/scientist/jong-fu-wong/">Jong Fu</a> has already tested with his assays so we know they effectively inhibit ACVR1, but I thought it would be a good idea to try them out on my DIPG cells and see how well they can kill them. I included a few different variables in this screen to test what could make a difference to the outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tested cells grown in 2D and 3D because this has been noted to change the outcome of compound screens in other systems</li>
<li>I tested the compounds alone, or in addition to radiation in order to test whether the compounds were effective in addition to current DIPG treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested how effective each compound is by growing cells for 7 days in the presence of the compound. At the end I measured how alive or healthy the cells were (i.e. their viability) by using a pre-developed kit that measures the amount of ATP inside the cell by using an enzyme that can produce light when ATP is present. ATP is measured because this is sometimes called the &#8216;energy currency of the cell&#8217; so living cells have to have ATP inside them, whereas dead cells won&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be counted.</p>
<p>This screen produced a lot of data at once which is best visualised as heatmaps like these:</p>
<div id="attachment_2227" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2227" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png" alt="" width="780" height="929" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png 860w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-252x300.png 252w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-768x914.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ACVR1 inhibitor M4K2009 is best at reducing mutant ACVR1 DIPG cell viability, but is not effective in ACVR1 wild-type cells</strong><br />Heatmaps showing the viability (relative to an untreated control) of a 2D culture of mutant ACVR1 DIPG cells (A) or wild-type ACVR1 DIPG cells (B) following 7 days in the presence of 1μM of the indicated ALK2 inhibitors. The colour of each box indicates how viable the cells were at the end (where blue indicates an improvement in viability and red indicates a drop in viability). Each column indicates an individual (technical repeats, n1-3) grouped into those done at the same time (biological repeats 1-3).</p></div>
<p>From that heatmap you can see that M4K2009 is the best at killing ACVR1 mutant cells (the top heatmap), but it isn&#8217;t as effective in cells where the ACVR1 gene is not mutated (&#8220;wild-type&#8221; cells). In those cells instead M4K2096 is the most effective compound (but still not to the same extent as M4K2009).</p>
<p>But this is only the data for cells grown in 2 dimensions without a radiation treatment. If you want to see the full dataset, you can read my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2000673#.XAqo_FX7SUk">Zenodo post</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are part of <a href="https://www.als-rap.org/">ALS-RAP</a>, the ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) Reproducible Antibody Platform. We’re addressing one of the big conundrums to biomedical research: the lack, or the poor quality, of many antibodies used for research ranging from cell biology to histopathology.</p>
<p>ALS, also called MND (motor neurone disease), is a group of diseases that cause degeneration of motor neurones. The symptoms vary, but the disease is debilitating, life-threatening and currently incurable. Around 5,000 people in the UK, and 12,000 people in the US, are currently affected. There are charities in several countries devoted to helping patients and supporting research, including the <a href="http://www.alsa.org/">ALS Association</a> (US), <a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/">MNDA association</a> (UK) and the <a href="https://www.als.ca/">ALS Society of Canada</a>; they all have very informative web sites. These three charities have joined forces to fund the ALS-RAP project</p>
<p>Up to 10% of cases are hereditary, and the genetic changes have been mapped for many of these cases. Mutations of C9ORF72 and SOD1, TDP-43 and FUS are most common, but there are dozens of other genes that are mutated less frequently. Studying the ALS-related genes and their roles in healthy nerve function and in disease are keys to understanding the biology and pathology and, eventually, finding cures. To do that, we need high-quality, validated reagents; in many cases, these do not exist (or we have no way of knowing, because we haven’t tested them properly!)</p>
<p>So here’s our plan. We have set up a collaboration with Susanne Gräslund at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and with Tom Durcan and Peter McPherson at the Montreal Neurological Institute (McGill University).</p>
<p>First, we consulted our advisory board to build an initial <a href="https://www.als-rap.org/target-list">target list</a>; this is mostly based on genetic data, nicely summarized <a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/DNND.S84956">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Canadian groups are establishing a robust validation process: basically, using cells that express “native” levels of the target protein, and matched CRISPR knockout cells, to probe the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies. They have started to probe commercial antibodies</p>
<p>The Stockholm team has libraries of single-chain antibody variable domains (scFv) in bacteriophage; they will screen the library to isolate and characterize antibodies to each target protein. We also expect contributions of new antibodies from commercial collaborators, who will (of course) put these on their catalogues.</p>
<p>The Oxford team (that’s Tracy Keates and me) are expressing and purifying the target proteins as biotinylated, well-folded proteins or protein domains, to be used as antigens for antibody screening.</p>
<p><strong>You can see the details in our web page: <a href="http://www.als-rap.org">www.als-rap.org</a> , including the target list, target status, plasmids and protocols, validation data (soon) etc. </strong></p>
<p>In the next blog, I’ll tell more about our cloning campaign to generate the antigens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I’m Opher Gileadi, I head a group at the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) in Oxford. For many years, we’ve been looking at proteins involved in human. We’ve looked at a wide variety of proteins: from DNA repair enzymes and transcription factors to enzymes involved in signalling. In most cases, we focus on early work: structure determination, activity assays, antibody generation, and finding initial small molecule “hits”. Having the right reagents are the key to enabling new drug targets; we expect that our data will allow – or encourage – further work by medicinal chemists and biologists to seriously test therapeutic hypotheses (we call our data and reagents sets <a href="https://www.thesgc.org/tep">TEPs</a> – Target Enabling Packages).</p>
<p>My team and I will be blogging and sharing our experiments on three areas of interest:</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer’s disease</strong>: We are funded by the NIH through the <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/amp-ad">AMP-AD</a> project (Accelerating Medicines Partnership &#8211; Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease). The project has integrated data from brain autopsies and model systems to identify new possible protein targets for treatment or prevention of Alzheimer’s (annotated in the <a href="https://agora.ampadportal.org/genes/(genes-router:genes-list)">Agora</a> web site, run by <a href="http://sagebionetworks.org/research-projects/agora/">SAGE Bionetworks</a>. Our group is generating TEPs for some of these targets – we’ll share our progress in future posts.</p>
<p><strong>ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)</strong>: We are part of <a href="https://www.als-rap.org/">ALS-RAP</a>, the ALS reproducible antibody platform. We’re addressing one of the big conundrums to biomedical research: the lack, or the poor quality, of many antibodies used for research ranging from cell biology to histopathology.</p>
<p>Together with colleagues in Stockholm and Montreal we aim to validate a set of antibodies to 30 proteins involved in the disease. We will test commercial antibodies as well as generate new ones through phage display technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Chordoma</strong>: <a href="https://www.chordomafoundation.org/understanding-chordoma/">Chordoma</a> is a rare type of cancer that occurs in the bones of the skull base and spine. It is resistant to all forms of chemotherapy; patients are treated by surgery and radiation, but recurrence is common and, eventually, untreatable. A unifying molecular characteristic of chordoma is overexpression of a variant of the transcription factor T-Brachyury (TBXT), which is essential for survival of the cancer cells. Joseph Newman in my group has solved structures of the human Brachyury protein (PDB codes <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6F58">6F58</a>, <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6F59">6F59</a>); we are working together with groups in the University of North Carolina and in Baylor College (Texas) to explore TBXT as a drug target.</p>
<p>That’s all for today – we’ll follow-up with stories in these three areas.</p>
