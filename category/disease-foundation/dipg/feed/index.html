				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Special thanks to:</strong></p>
<p>David Drewry – Helped with designing the nanoBRET tracers</p>
<p>M4K pharma OICR chemist team – Synthesised the M4K1046-linker derivatives</p>
<p>Carrow Wells (UNC) – Conjugated the M4K1046 to nanoBRET fluorophore</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I have always wanted to establish nanoBRET target engagement assay for ALK5. Relative to dual luciferase promoter assay and immunofluorescent staining, nanoBRET is many times faster. With a robust ALK5 nanoBRET assay, I will be able to rapidly screen for cellular off-target activity.</p>
<p>Since none of the commercial nanoBRET tracers worked with ALK5, we attempted to generate our own tracers. We chose to create these bespoke tracers based on M4K1046 because it has cellular IC50 of ~50nM for ALK5. David Drewry has helped to design linkers that will attach fluorophores (nanoBRET energy acceptor) to the solvent-facing end of M4K1046. Based on known structures, additional bulk in this region should not hinder the binding of the compounds to ALK5. Two versions of M4K1046 (with different linker length) were synthesised by the M4K pharma chemist team in OICR. They were subsequently sent to Carrow Wells for conjugation to nanoBRET fluorophore.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to determine the binding of these tracers to ALK5-nanoluciferase fusion. Therefore, I incubated increasing concentrations of tracer with HEK293 cells expressing ALK5-nanoluciferase fusion protein. If the tracers can bind nicely to the ATP pocket of ALK5, incubation with increasing concentrations of tracer will result in increasing BRET signal (wavelength = 610 nm). The resulting magnitude of BRET and EC50 estimated from the curve are good indicators to whether these tracers can be used for nanoBRET assay with ALK5.</p>
<p>To identify any background signal, I have included a replicate of the above experiment with 10,000nM of parent M4K1046. These unlabelled compound will saturate ALK5 ATP pockets and prevent the binding of nanoBRET tracers. All signal from this set of experiment is contributed by non-specific background.</p>
<p>To be eliminate doubts of any technical or reagent issues with the nanoBRET experiment itself, I have replicated both experiments above, substituting ALK5 with ALK2.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Both bespoke tracers cannot be used for ALK5 nanoBRET. Both of them did not bind to ALK5. The nanoBRET experiment itself was a success since both tracers worked well with ALK2 (over 20 folds assay windows). The background noise was low for both tracers. ALK5 seems to intrinsically not tolerate bulky additions on the solvent end of M4K1046. This might be additional avenue for improving ALK2 vs ALK5 selectivity. At the very least, we have gained this additional information from these efforts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post I’d like to return to looking at my work on phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is a key signalling method for activating the BMP pathway and inducing activity. Specifically activation of ALK2 by phosphorylation leads to phosphorylation of SMAD1 which leads to gene transcription that ultimately is responsible for bone formation.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to talk about two experiments – the first is looking at the rate of phosphorylation (or how active) of two ALK2 mutants, L196P and R258S. The second is to look at mapping the exact sites of phosphorylation on two of the more common ALK2 mutations in FOP, R206H and Q027E.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phosphorylation over time in ALK2 L196P and R258S.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve talked <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/phosphorylation-of-smad1-rates-as-a-function-of-alk2-mutations-and-type-ii-association/">previously</a> about how phosphorylation is effected by the Q207E and R206H mutations in ALK2. This time I wanted to look at some additional mutants that are found in a small proportion of cases of FOP, specifically L196P, R258S, G328E and R375P. I purified the long forms of these ALK2 mutations in a standard fashion. Regrettably only L196P and R258S gave a good yield of expressed protein while the other two constructs gave me no expression of protein. I set up my standard activation assay with these ALK2 mutants (I mixed them with SMAD1 and with either ACVR2 or BMPR2, before adding ATP, DTT and Mg2+/Mn2+ in order to start the reaction), taking samples over time periodically up to 30 minutes. The samples were then analysed by mass spec to look for intact mass shifts corresponding to phosphorylation.</p>
<p>I plotted the peaks corresponding to phosphorylated states of both ALK2 and SMAD1 at the different time points and used this 3D graph to compare different mutant’s behaviour with respect to the activity of ALK2. I also compared this data to previously obtained data from the previous blog post.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2580" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-806x1024.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="991" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-236x300.jpg 236w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-768x975.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Time course plots for phosphorylation of SMAD1 (top) and ALK2 L196P or R258S (bottom) in the presence of ACVR2 (left) or BMPR2 (right). Legend shows time point in seconds.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall we can see that R258S appears to be more activating than L196P with both more SMAD activation over the first five minutes (including the appearance of a potentially interesting third SMAD binding site). This is the case when using either ACVR2 or BMPR2. Also in general ACVR2 appears to lead to more SMAD activation than BMPR2 regardless of mutation.</p>
<p>When looking at ALK2 phosphorylation, we can see that L196P is quickly phosphorylated up to three times compared to R258S but that over the course of five minutes, R258S accumulates up to 6 phosphorylation’s much more rapidly than L196P. This effect is most pronounced when paired with ACVR2.</p>
<p>What this means in very broad terms is that the different ALK2 FOP mutants are differently activating and that their response to different type II receptors change depending on which mutation is present. This is similar to the results seen with other ALK2 mutants studied previously. This builds towards understanding why the ALK2 FOP mutations leads to increased signalling and thus increased bone formation and exactly what is going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phosphomapping of ALK2 R206H and Q207E:</strong></p>
<p>Another aspect of looking at the phosphorylation of ALK2 and SMAD1 is not just how much it is phosphorylated but also where it is phosphorylated. For this I worked with Rod Chalk in our mass spec department to map the phosphorylation sites present in samples of protein incubated as previously mentioned. In this case I was looking at Q207E and R206H mutants of ALK2 paired with either ACVR2 or BMPR2, all in the presence of SMAD. This suggested that many of the phosphorylations could be traced to the following positions in the GS region of the kinase regardless of ALK2 mutation:</p>
<p><strong><u>ST</u></strong>LADLLDH<strong><u>S</u></strong>C<strong><u>TS</u></strong>G<strong><u>S</u></strong>G<strong><u>S</u></strong>GLPFLVQRTV</p>
<p>However not all these sites are seen at the same time and it is hard to determine which are essential for transmission of signal and ALK2 activation.</p>
<p>Similarly phosphorylation on SMAD1 could be traced to the following common locations at the C-terminal tail of the protein:</p>
<p>TQMGSPHNPI<strong><u>SS</u></strong>V<strong><u>S</u></strong></p>
<p>In this case it is the last three serines in the tail that are able to be phosphorylated and again, are seen with both mutations. Combinations of the three possible sites and all three at once were seen as possibilities within the phosphomapping data.</p>
<p>What this means however is a bit less clear. When considering the time course data from the previous post linked as well as the new mutant time course data and the phosphomapping it seems to suggest that you require multiple (up to 6) ALK2 phosphorylations to get maximal (3 site) SMAD1 phosphorylation and that there are at least this many sites in the GS loop and the region just prior to it.</p>
<p>In order to properly probe the necessity of each of these sites, it is going to be necessary to repeat these mass spec experiments on knock out mutants that remove the phosphorylation sites in various combinations, to really see which are essential for ALK2 activation. These are currently being cloned so hopefully I’ll be able to test them soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the technical details for all these experiments over on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2591062">Zenodo.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know as many as 30% of the cells in labs could be misidentified? And what a nightmare it would be to find out years of your work are just completely wrong because you got your skin cells mixed up with your brain cells&#8230;</p>
<p>So to avoid that catastrophe, I took some time to check the DNA sequence of the ACVR1 gene, because for this gene we know what should be mutated (or not) for each of my cell lines. This way I can make sure that I haven&#8217;t mixed them up in the past year (<em>and</em> that they haven&#8217;t picked up new mutations in this important area all by themselves).</p>
<p>All I had to do was collect the genomes of the cells, amplify specifically the ACVR1 gene, send it for overnight sequencing, and then I get a trace like this back from the facility:</p>

<p>Each DNA base has one peak, except one that has both a guanine (G) and an adenine (A) DNA base. The adenine, present on one chromosome, causes the change from an arginine (R) to a histidine (H) at the 206th position of the ACVR1 protein i.e. the R206H mutation.</p>
<p>This trace is from the HSJD-DIPG-007 cell line and is the mutation I expected. According to all my sequencing, none of my cell lines have gotten mixed up, yay!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ZFYVE9C (Otherwise known as SARA) is a scaffold protein involved in the association of various protein components as part of the TGFB signalling pathway. The equivalent in the BMP signalling pathway is a protein known as Endofin so studying SARA (which is slightly easier) might give us useful insights for both proteins. For more details on this project please see <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/a-summary-of-my-alk2-project-goals/">this blog post.</a></p>
<p>One of the unanswered questions about SARA is what does one of the major domains that it has actually do? (The domain is known as a DUF domain, or a Domain of Unknown Function!) We know the structure but that hasn’t given us any clues as to its function. One thought was that it might be involved in recruiting type I or type II receptors close to their binding partners such as one of the SMADs to allow signal propagation.</p>
<p>I purified the DUF domain of SARA and mixed it with either excess TGFBR1 or excess TGFBR2 (the two relevant receptors in the TGFB pathway). I tested the receptors in both the unphosphorylated (inactive) and phosphorylated (active) states. After incubating the samples for 30 minutes while concentrating the volume back down to &lt;5ml, I ran them down a gel filtration column to see if the two proteins bound together sufficiently to shift the peaks coming off the column which would indicate they were acting as a complex of larger mass.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2516" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-1024x491.png" alt="" width="780" height="374" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-1024x491.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-300x144.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-768x368.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c.png 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Overlay of the UV traces from all the size exclusion gel filtration runs to show the relative elution volumes of the peaks confirming no shift in the ZFYVE9C peak consistent with no complex being formed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn’t see any shift in the peak for SARA suggesting that either the two proteins don’t bind or that the affinity is weak enough that they fall apart under the conditions of the gel filtration column.</p>
<p>The next thing to try will be to purify the proteins again but not to cleave the tag on one of the binding partners (either the receptors or the SARA protein) and try to do a pull down experiment to test whether this shows any association or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve not posted in a while, mainly because things have been really busy, but good busy, as I now have 3 new datasets/structures, of ALK2 with M4K2118, M4K2149 and, amazingly, M4K2009. As you know, this is our lead candidate, which until now has not behaved very well in crystal trials, and it hasn’t been possible to get decent crystals. In my last post I told you how I had somehow managed to mix up the TNIK and ACVR1/ALK2 tubes when I was setting up the plates, and accidentally put ACVR1 into a coarse screen and TNIK into a fine screen for ACVR1. Well, after I got lovely big crystals for what I thought was ACVR1 with M4K3003, I sent them to the synchrotron, got beautiful data to 1.4 Å, phased it, and lo and behold! It was M4K2009 snugly fitted into the binding pocket (see the ligand density after molecular replacement below). Of course, I didn’t notice this was a trimethoxy containing compound (how??) before I excitedly emailed everyone to tell them I had M4K3003, and then had to retract … However, the story ends well as M4K2009 is really important.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2511" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="509" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-768x432.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, I got data for M4K2149 (~2.6 Å), one of the amide head group containing compounds we’re interested to see, and M4K2118 (~1.4 Å), which is doing well in some of the other assays too. I’ve put the .mtz files <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2573142#.XGw9g-j7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo if you want to play with high resolution data, and some images below showing the ligand density and the ligands binding in the pocket. The amide head group of M4K2149 appears to preserve the water network in the pocket that we’ve observed in other structures, but as the resolution is too low for waters, we can’t tell til we get higher resolution data. Which hopefully will be this week, as I’ve grown some really pretty crystals for M4K2149 that I hope will diffract better. These appeared quite by accident again, as I’d designed a fine screen around the D5 well condition of my mega composite screen, but neglected to notice when I validated the screen that I’d put 10 x less ammonium sulphate in one row than intended – should have been 0.9 M, but ended up being 0.09 M. I should probably start calling myself ‘the accidental crystallographer’ at this rate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2509" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve got some small crystals for M4K3007, another structure we really want, and some pretty ones for M4K2184, another amide head group compound. I’ve followed up the M4K3007, just waiting to see if anything appears, and will send the tiny ones to the synchrotron while waiting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2508" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png" alt="" width="849" height="478" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" /></p>
<p>I’m also very happy to say that our new M4K2117 crystal system for XChem fragment screening has worked very nicely so far, in the sense that the crystals are large and relatively robust and can handle soaking in low salt conditions as well as compounds with DMSO for a few hours. They then still diffract to around 1.2-1.8 Å, consistently in the same space group, C 1 2 1. This is a vast improvement over the previous system with LDN-193189. We did a solvent characterisation and pre-screen a couple of weeks ago with 100 crystals, and of the 20 or so hits we got, none was in the allosteric pocket we are looking for. This could be because of the 1.4 M ammonium sulphate and 0.2 M Na/K tartrate I have in there, which might prevent access of fragments to the pocket. Thus, using the remarkable shifter that Nathan Wright at SGC designed, we’ll be transferring loads of crystals from grow plates to low salt soak plates before doing the compound soaks this week, with the same 100 compounds, in order to check if the hit rate/location changes.</p>
<p>I will mention though, for anyone who may never have noticed this, the DMSO concentration in the protein solution for crystallisation is very important! I had previously been using Batch 1 of M4K2117 for my co-crystallisation, but it ran out so I used Batch 2, which was a 50 mM stock, as opposed to the previous 25 mM stock. The plates I set up with this, the same in every other way, gave showers of rather ugly, crunchy, small crystals. So I tried a few things – diluted the stock to 25 mM in DMSO and set up plates with that, with both lower and higher concentrations of protein (8 and 14 mg/ml along with the usual 10-11 mg/ml), as well as using the stock as is, with lower and higher protein concentrations. The lower stock concentrations brought back the big, perfect, beautiful crystals from before, the higher stock, no matter the protein concentration, gave ugly chunks and showers. The final concentration of compound was the same in all, so clearly the DMSO percentage is a very important factor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I’d spend a blog post just talking about the various paths of my research and try and tie it all together. A lot of my experiments do dot around these various arms of investigation and so one experimental post doesn’t necessarily tie in directly with the previous one or the next one and I thought it might be a good idea to explain why and summarise where I’m up to with each strand.</p>
<p>My main focus of research is to investigate the cause of the disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). We know that it’s caused by a mutation in ALK2 which leads to excessive bone formation. This also nicely dovetails with research done into DIPG where 25% of cases share a mutation with FOP in ALK2.</p>
<p>My research can be broken down in to three main strands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is looking at characterising the binding of ligands to ALK2 in order to optimise binding and work towards finding a potent and specific inhibitor. This is the focus of a lot of the M4K work that Jong Fu and Ros are doing and I’ve been doing a little bit of that as well but it’s not the main focus of my work. This endeavour is going fairly well – despite setbacks relating to protein expression (which are not entirely solved – we now have regained expression of the kinase domain alone but we still don’t have expression of the kinase domain and GS loop construct) and Ros has a number of structures that she’s working on at the moment that have been recently collected. Alas I’ve not had as much luck with new structures recently. We frequently get new deliveries of compounds from M4K to test – Jong Fu looks at them in cells while Ros and I try and crystallise the most promising candidates with varying degrees of success. Ros and I have also attempted XChem fragment screening which is where we use high throughput crystallography to identify small weakly bound fragments that might identify new leads for drug design or in our case, help us identify drugs that might bind to a second allosteric site within ALK2 away from the main ligand binding pocket. An XChem update will be coming soon from either Ros or myself as I’ve recently started helping her with this aspect of the work and so have been shadowing her on our last couple of visits to Diamond.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The second is investigating the interactions of the type I receptor (ALK2) with its partnering type II in order to activate SMAD 1/5/8. This covers looking at receptor cross reactivity, SMAD cross reactivity, and the influence of mutations on this. This also involves looking at crystal structures of the mutants where possible, attempting to make complexes of the type I and type II receptors in order to try and crystallise them and probing the activities of the proteins and the various disease mutants. Covered in this is everything I’ve done using western blots and mass spec to identify the dependencies of this complex as required for SMAD phosphorylation. So far I know that the mutants are more active than the wild type (with R206H being the most active ALK2 mutation), that the type II must be present but does not need to be active to allow for SMAD activation and that increased activity is not solely dependent upon the removal of inhibition by FKBP12. Covered in this is also the work looking at mapping the phosphorylation sites in ALK2 to try and identify if some of these sites are more critical than others with relation to SMAD activation. The cloning I recently talked about is part of this investigation, making mutations to remove certain phosphorylation sites and comparing the activity of these with the wild type. As soon as these constructs have been cloned into suitable expression vectors I’ll be starting that experiment too. Another aspect of this is looking at the association of other proteins with the receptors, such as the possible link between them and XIAP as I talked about in one earlier blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The third aspect is looking other proteins related to the ALK2 pathway such as Endofin. Endofin is a membrane associated protein with multiple domains including a SMAD binding domain and large areas of unknown function. It is involved with the co-localisation of various parts of the pathway and appears to act as something of a scaffold protein to hold things in close proximity for signal propagation. The equivalent protein in the TGFβ pathway is called SARA and appears to have a similar function in that pathway. Some time ago I solved the structure for a domain of unknown function within SARA (4BKW) which contained a novel fold and showed structural (but not sequence) similarity to a protein called SUFU, which is part of the Hedgehog signalling pathway. We still don’t know what this protein and domain does or what it binds to or how it functions and so this is another area of investigation. If we can uncover the function of SARA we can also try and uncover the function of Endofin and this might provide a better understanding of the way FOP mutations work and help us see if there are any other ways we can target the pathway that are not exclusively based on inhibiting ALK2 activity. However given that the DUF domain has very little information about it, our investigations into what it does have been limited thus far. My goals with this are to try and probe the role of the DUF domain looking for whether it binds to either of the type I or type II receptors, and if so which parts of the receptors, or if it associates with a different protein all together. Given we know very little about what it does and the structure offers few clues (the lack of sequence similarity to SUFU means that although we can predict a possible binding mode, the nature of what binds there is very hard to determine as there are no conserved residues) this is quite a difficult problem to approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My work moves between these three strands depending on how much and which proteins I’ve got available to me &#8211; do I have any in the freezer already purified or do I need to make fresh? And that’s if I have the pellets in the freezer of the expressed protein in the first place. It also varies depending on whether we have new compounds we’re interested in testing immediately from either M4K or other collaborators, or whether I’ve got data I need to analyse from previous successful crystallisation attempts. Sometimes I’ll be looking at my own structural data and sometimes I’ll be looking at someone else’s structure which we call ‘proofreading’ to double check it for errors and make sure nothing has been missed. Sometimes we’ll have time at Diamond and so everything else has to be put on hold in order to make use of that visit (such as XChem trips) and sometimes there’s a lot of data analysis to do on other experiments &#8211; writing it up and understanding what the data is telling us is just as important for progress as the experiments themselves.</p>
<p>Having the three strands means I can move from one to another as each strand has its own peaks and lulls in activity at different times. I’m afraid it does make for a slightly more disjointed blog journey but I hope you’ll bear with me through it all as I try and make sense of the problems I’m investigating.</p>
<p>I’ll try and post again sooner rather than later on what I’ve been doing in January as it has been really rather bitty and frustrating in terms of things actually working but hopefully February will bring with it some more productive experiments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/optimising-an-assay-to-detect-alkaline-phosphatase-activity-in-c2c12-cells/">when I tested this assay with the standard C2C12 cell line it didn&#8217;t work particularly well</a> so I&#8217;ve decided to try again with a new set of cells. This time I&#8217;m choosing connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) from FOP patients as a reporter cell line because they respond more strongly to the signals that activate the BMP pathway (called BMP ligands).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never worked with these cells before so, again, I needed to work out how many I&#8217;ll need to get a good result from the assay. These cells however grow as a very thin sheet which is so see-through that I initially couldn&#8217;t tell if the wells were full. To solve this I used stains called Calcein AM and Hoechst. Calcein AM can stain any living cell because they metabolise it from a see-through molecule into a fluorescent green product, whereas Hoechst can stick to DNA and turn all the cell nuclei blue, and so suddenly, all of my cells glow:</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t they pretty?</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re this easy to see, it&#8217;s even easier to see how many cells are needed to fill a well, but not get overcrowded. You can read more about how I did that in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2546911">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The only question I have left is why some cells didn&#8217;t stain with Calcein AM, even though their nucleus looks fine? Anyone know the answer?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone and happy New Year! I really, really wanted to end the year on a high note in December before I went off on holiday, but as it turned out, I didn’t have enough time to set up 18 plates and write a blog post on the last day. So I’ll just have to start the year on a high note.</p>
<p>I’m very happy to say I got another ACVR1/ALK2 structure in December, at 2 Å resolution, co-crystallised with M4K2158 (see images below, and the .mtz autoprocessed file is available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo). The structure is not fully refined yet, but what’s interesting is the solvent side of the molecule is being stabilised by either a water contact (Chain A) or Asp293 (Chain B). This gives it really good density.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2367" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2367 " src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png" alt="" width="855" height="481" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/M4K2158_structure.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 bound to M4K2158 at ~2 Å, showing interactions with His286 and a water at the back of the pocket</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also seem to have some new <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">pretty </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">hits with M4K2118, M4K2149 and M4K3003 (crystal pics below). What’s interesting about the M4K3003 hits is that I’ve really struggled to get crystals with this compound (as well as M4K3007 and 3010), and it is a pretty desirable structure. These hits came about as a result of a mistake, where I somehow managed to mix up my tubes and put ACVR1 with M4K3003 into my mega composite screen without seeds, and TNIK into a fine screen I had intended for ACVR1 with seeds. I only discovered this because I mass specced the TNIK just before setting up the plates, then rushed off to do them as it was the SGC Christmas party that night and I needed to finish (best not to rush experiments). When I checked the mass spec result later, I got the exact mass of ACVR1! So I went back to the crystallography room and recovered what protein I could from the source plate for the TNIK plates, and mass specced it again. Same result – ACVR1. But when I looked at the drop images for those plates (now containing ACVR1 + M4K3003), I found a bunch of crystals! Happy serendipity!! These will go on the trip to Diamond on the 21</span><sup>st</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> of January and then we’ll know whether the mistake really ended well or not. Fingers crossed!</span></p>

<div id="attachment_2366" style="width: 893px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2366" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 co-crystallised with M4K2149, 2118 and 3003 &#8211; hits to send to the synchrotron</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may well ask, why was I setting up plates with TNIK? As it happens, some of our collaborators’ assays show M4K2009, our main compound of interest, hits both TNIK and DDR1 with pretty high affinity. We’ve been struggling to get crystals of ACVR1 with M4K2009 – for whatever reason, it doesn’t want to make crystals. So it seemed like a good idea to see if TNIK or DDR1 will co-crystallise with it. TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK Interacting Kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an activator of the Wnt signalling pathway. DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) is a tyrosine kinase that functions as cell surface receptor for fibrillar collagen and regulates cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, differentiation, survival and cell proliferation (according to its GeneCard).</p>
<p>While I was about it, I thought it would be useful to set up plates with BMPR1A (ALK3), for the same reason I set up TGFBR1 (ALK5) before – to see what off-target structures look like with some of these compounds. The purification protocols for TNIK and BMPR1A were as standard, but they’re available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo.</p>
<p>Some other good news is that I’ve figured out how to reproduce my XChem crystals fairly reliably. On the last day before the holidays I set up 6 plates of ACVR1 with M4K2117, which gives really beautiful, well-diffracting crystals. I used 10, 12 and 15 mg/ml protein, and made plates with and without seeds. Well, the ones without the seeds grew fabulously, within 2 weeks, and the ones with seeds didn’t! The next step with these then is to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. That&#8217;ll be for next week. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>I determined the potency of 24 new ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors synthesised by OICR. M4K2009 in particular is quite potent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50">larger values indicates lower potency</a>). This compound differs from legacy compound M4K1055 by the position of its methyl group (CH3) in the middle of the molecule. Attempts to replace the tri-methoxy group (the three CH3-O groups bonded to the phenyl ring) were not successful. Since a robust nanoBRET tracer is not available for TGFBR1/ALK5, I will use dual luciferase promoter assay (orthologous assay) to determine the off-target activity of these compounds towards TGFBR1/ALK5.</p>
