				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation of the efficacy of M4K compounds in DIPG patient-derived cell lines is essential before any promising compounds can be further tested in mouse xenograft models. This approach can aid in narrowing down clinical compound candidates and reduce the time, resources and animal sacrifice needed downstream.</p>
<p>A robust and efficient readout for the changes in the viability of the DIPG cells needs to be established before it can be used to evaluate the M4K compounds. In addition, the amount of cells to be seeded at the beginning of the experiment has to be optimised to avoid overcrowding and starvation of the cells after extended culture times. Overcrowding and starvation will lead to increased cell death and prevent accurate estimation of the potency of M4K compounds (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC50">EC50</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p>
<p>The wells of 96-well plate with transparent bottom will be coated with laminin to synchronise the mode of growth (adherent or non-adherent) among the different patient-derived lines. Additionally, this will promote even distribution of cells and allow most cells to be in focus when images are taken.</p>
<p>An increasing cell number (125 to 20000) will be seeded into each well. The amount of cells after 7 days of growth in 100µl of medium will be measured based on the area occupied and the total amount of ATP present in each well. In addition, propidium iodide which stains dead cells will be added at the beginning the experiment. At seeding number that are not saturating, the amount of cells after 7 days should remain proportional to the initial seeding number.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>1) Celigo and its algorithm is able to quantify the area occupied by the cells accurately.</p>
<p>2) SU-DIPG-IV and HSJD-DIPG-007 proliferate quickly. Seeding too many of these cells at the beginning of the experiment will saturate both confluency and CellTiter Glo readouts.</p>
<p>3) CellTiter Glo signal and confluency are good indicators of the actual quantity of cells in the well. Below 5000 cells seeded per well, both sets of measurements correlated almost perfectly with each other.</p>
<p>4) Cell death (as indicated by propidium iodide signal) in relation to total cell at endpoint increases when too many cells were seeded at the beginning of the experiment.</p>
<p>5) Initial cell seeding numbers for each patient-derived cell lines that do not lead to overcrowding at the end of the experiment can be chosen based on the linearity of CellTiter Glo signal and the intensity of propidium iodide.</p>
<p><strong>In a nut shell:</strong></p>
<p>We now have the parameters to go ahead and evaluate how well M4K compounds can stop the growth or kill DIPG cells.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing with our goal to synthesize three compounds as ALK2 inhibitors, let’s refer back to Scheme 2 in the previous post on this topic, compounds <strong>6</strong>, <strong>8</strong> and <strong>9</strong> were synthesized in good yields (65-90%), however compound <strong>10</strong> could not be obtained.</p>
<div id="attachment_2597" style="width: 748px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM.png" alt="" width="738" height="522" class=" wp-image-2597" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM.png 918w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM-300x212.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM-768x544.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Scheme 2. Synthesis route 1</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Different conditions were tested to induce the cyclization of the bromo-pyrazine-2-carboxamide <strong>9</strong> to the target bromo-pyrazin-2-amine <strong>10</strong>. This reaction mostly yielded starting material <strong>9 </strong>and by-product <strong>11</strong> in low yields (&lt;15%). After several attempts, this approach (acid/heat) was abandoned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2926" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-4.17.14-PM.png" alt="" width="736" height="592" class=" wp-image-2926" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Scheme 3. Synthesis route 2</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative synthetic route is shown in Scheme 3.  Here, aminopirazine <strong>12</strong> will be reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) to yield carbaldehyde <strong>13</strong>, which then will be reacted with diamine <strong>6</strong> (previously synthesized) at 200 <sup>o</sup>C using dimethylacetamide (DMA) as a solvent. This last step can be carried out in a microwave reactor and should yield the cyclized compound pyridinpyrazin-2-amine <strong>14</strong>, which can be brominated with <em>N</em>-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) to yield compound <strong>10</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it was mentioned before, <strong>10 </strong>could not be synthesized by the previously proposed route. The new route is adapted from international patent WO 2008/071937 and we hope in this way we can access to this key intermediate in 150-200 mg scale to move forward with more reactions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the crystals from my last post I sent them along on the last Diamond trip we had to <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I04">beamline I04</a> but regrettably didn’t get any usable datasets. Perhaps fortunately there is a possible explanation for this that isn’t just ‘the crystals were a bit too rubbish’. We send our crystals to the Diamond Light Source and because of the high number of crystals sent on each trip by the department (124 on the last trip) not everyone goes along on every trip and we quite often use something called ‘auto-centering’ that uses a computer algorithm to find the edge of the loop and to align the loop and your crystal in the beam. Centering is necessary but also quite tricky, because to collect a data set you need ‘slices’ of data taken with the crystal at different angles so the loop the crystals are mounted in, is rotated by a robotic arm so that the crystal also rotates around inside the x-ray beam. Thus if your crystal isn’t aligned properly, as the loop rotates it moves you crystal out of the beam and thus you get no data at that point.</p>
<p>Usually the automatic alignment is really good, however this time around it didn’t work so well and quite often either my crystal wasn’t in the beam at all (it mistook the loop stem for the crystal) or it started in the beam and then rotated out of it (which is what I think happened in the case shown below where you can see two ‘periods’ of data with dips in between. This is, of course, suboptimal and leads to a data set that you can’t really use.</p>
<p>I’m resending the crystals to the beamline this Friday and hopefully going with them myself. The silver lining to this is that I know that some of them definitely diffract which is encouraging. Hopefully they’ll behave well when fully in the beam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/1.htm">Stem cells</a> are a set of cells that, unlike most cells in the body, can divide as many times as they want, and can turn into any cell in the body. The mutations in cancer often make the cells behave more like stem cells, because in order to grow into a large tumour they may need to divide hundreds or thousands of cells, and it can allow a single cell to escape to another part of the body and grow into a second tumour (this is called metastasis). Knowing whether all of the cells in a tumour, or even a small proportion of them behave like this, and whether they&#8217;re killed by new therapies can be important information &#8211; if just one of these cells survives theoretically they can regrow into an entire new tumour.</p>
<p>And this ability to regenerate an tumour is just how we test how many of these cells are present: I developed an assay where I dilute the cells until I can seed just a handful into each well, and then I count how many new colonies (like tiny tumours) have grown.</p>
<p>I then used a statistical rule (called <a href="http://www.biology-pages.info/L/LimitingDilution.html">the Poisson distribution</a>) and a programming package (called R) to work out at what dilution there is just one stem-like cell present i.e. if only one stem cell is present when I seeded 5 cells then 20% are stem-like.</p>

<p>Although I need to repeat it to make sure the result is reliable, it seems that almost all of the cells in this line are stem-like! <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2669443">If you&#8217;d like to read about the technical details of this experiment you can do so here.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been lucky enough to have a student (Mira) in the lab working with me for the past few weeks and so I’d like to write about the work that we’ve been doing together.</p>
<p>We spent some time cleaning up an old sample of ALK2 that Ros had left over in the freezer to set up in crystal plates with some compounds from M4K Pharma that they were relatively keen to see the structures of.</p>
<p>We used a specialised coarse screen that Ros had designed containing only conditions where we had previously seen crystals in the wider coarse screens. This means that we can narrow down the field where we’re expecting to find crystals and test fewer conditions to find the one we need – this means setting up fewer plates and thus needing less protein per compound tested, so is overall more efficient.</p>
<p>We set up the plates (at 4C and 20C) at around 9mg/ml with compounds M4K2163, M4K2143, M4K2192, M4K2207 and M4K2194 at 1mM concentration from 25mM stocks.</p>
<p>We found some interesting crystals, one of which was mountable as is (from M4K2192) and several across all the compounds, which showed small crystals that would be worth following up in more specific conditions.</p>

<p><em>Crystals of ALK2/ACVR1A with compound M4K2192</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Mira designed some follow up screens based on the conditions that showed small crystals and we set up some more plates with those conditions in the hope of turning those small crystals into larger, better crystals. We had enough protein to set up followup plates for compounds M4K2163 and M4K2143 at 9.5mg/ml. From these plates we mounted 5 crystals across the board and combined with those above ended up with crystals of unknown quality across three compounds. These have been confirmed as containing protein by imaging the drops by UV light (UV light interacts with protein to make crystals only visible under UV light if they contain protein rather than just being salt) and are now waiting to be sent to the synchrotron to see if they actually diffract or not.  You can read more about the technical details <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2650203#.XMB29jBKiUk">here on Zenodo.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve got a few things to catch up with on the blog – one of them is to talk about a conference I attended in Oxford recently. I attended the <a href="https://www.biochemistry.org/Events/tabid/379/MeetingNo/SA217/view/Conference/Default.aspx">Biochemical Society BMP Signalling in Cancer II</a> meeting which was held in St. Annes College, Oxford. At this meeting I presented a poster on the work I’ve been doing (and which has been written about here as it’s happened) on looking at how the mutations in ALK2 effect the underlying activity of the kinase as well as effecting how well FKBP12 can inhibit ALK2.</p>
<p>The conference brought together 60 researchers in the field from around the world talking about a variety of different cancers but also other BMP related conditions such as FOP. Over three days there were some fantastic talks by the leaders in the field including from Dr. Caroline Hill from the Crick Institute in London who spoke about receptor cross talk in BMP signalling and how that might affect signalling through ALK2 and Prof. Eileen Shore from the university of Pennsylvania who spoke about mechanosensing and tissue stiffness in FOP.</p>
<p>I had a chance to get into some really interesting conversations with some of the attendees about the way their work and my work intersected and how we might be able to collaborate in the future – particularly interesting was talking to some Postdocs from Caroline Hill’s group who are looking at similar problems to me but from an in-cell perspective rather than using purified proteins. From that some interesting questions have been thrown up that I now want to test in my in-vitro systems and that will be detailed here as and when I’ve had a chance to try them. Hopefully this can lead to validation of both my work and theirs by complementing in-vivo and in-vitro approaches.</p>
<p>I thought it would be good to share the poster I created here – so you can find it <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2640488#.XLRgljBKiUk">over on Zenodo</a>. It is designed for a scientific audience but not necessarily an FOP specialist audience so hopefully it should be fairly easy to follow. It leads the reader through the story of explaining that Gain of Function (GOF) mutations in ALK2 are involved in diseases like FOP and DIPG. I then go on to present data that shows that these mutations disrupt the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12 but that this isn’t the whole story (as regular readers of this blog will know). Then I talk about what I found out about what is needed for SMAD activation by ALK2 before looking at the increased phosphorylation of SMAD1 by the mutant ALK2 proteins compared to the wild type. This covers both the western blot data that shows more SMAD1 activation but also the mass spec data I’ve shared previously that looks at more SMAD1 and more ALK2 phosphorylation. Finally I showed the phosphomapping data on ALK2 that is starting to pick apart the exact phosphorylation locations on ALK2 that are necessary for SMAD1 activation (Also data I’ve talked about on this blog before). In this case it was nice to see that all the effort Rod and I had put into phosphomapping had paid off! Other groups had said they’d tried and been unable to map ALK2 using trypsin alone but our method of using 5 different enzymes both enriched and unenriched seems to have done the trick (despite it being 10x more work!).</p>
<p>There is great value from attending a conference like this and in this case I feel that I really did make some very important connections and had some very informative discussions that were directly relevant to my research and that will hopefully bear fruit in time and guide the direction of my experiments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Special thanks to:</strong></p>
<p>David Drewry – Helped with designing the nanoBRET tracers</p>
<p>M4K pharma OICR chemist team – Synthesised the M4K1046-linker derivatives</p>
<p>Carrow Wells (UNC) – Conjugated the M4K1046 to nanoBRET fluorophore</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I have always wanted to establish nanoBRET target engagement assay for ALK5. Relative to dual luciferase promoter assay and immunofluorescent staining, nanoBRET is many times faster. With a robust ALK5 nanoBRET assay, I will be able to rapidly screen for cellular off-target activity.</p>
<p>Since none of the commercial nanoBRET tracers worked with ALK5, we attempted to generate our own tracers. We chose to create these bespoke tracers based on M4K1046 because it has cellular IC50 of ~50nM for ALK5. David Drewry has helped to design linkers that will attach fluorophores (nanoBRET energy acceptor) to the solvent-facing end of M4K1046. Based on known structures, additional bulk in this region should not hinder the binding of the compounds to ALK5. Two versions of M4K1046 (with different linker length) were synthesised by the M4K pharma chemist team in OICR. They were subsequently sent to Carrow Wells for conjugation to nanoBRET fluorophore.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to determine the binding of these tracers to ALK5-nanoluciferase fusion. Therefore, I incubated increasing concentrations of tracer with HEK293 cells expressing ALK5-nanoluciferase fusion protein. If the tracers can bind nicely to the ATP pocket of ALK5, incubation with increasing concentrations of tracer will result in increasing BRET signal (wavelength = 610 nm). The resulting magnitude of BRET and EC50 estimated from the curve are good indicators to whether these tracers can be used for nanoBRET assay with ALK5.</p>
<p>To identify any background signal, I have included a replicate of the above experiment with 10,000nM of parent M4K1046. These unlabelled compound will saturate ALK5 ATP pockets and prevent the binding of nanoBRET tracers. All signal from this set of experiment is contributed by non-specific background.</p>
<p>To be eliminate doubts of any technical or reagent issues with the nanoBRET experiment itself, I have replicated both experiments above, substituting ALK5 with ALK2.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Both bespoke tracers cannot be used for ALK5 nanoBRET. Both of them did not bind to ALK5. The nanoBRET experiment itself was a success since both tracers worked well with ALK2 (over 20 folds assay windows). The background noise was low for both tracers. ALK5 seems to intrinsically not tolerate bulky additions on the solvent end of M4K1046. This might be additional avenue for improving ALK2 vs ALK5 selectivity. At the very least, we have gained this additional information from these efforts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post I’d like to return to looking at my work on phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is a key signalling method for activating the BMP pathway and inducing activity. Specifically activation of ALK2 by phosphorylation leads to phosphorylation of SMAD1 which leads to gene transcription that ultimately is responsible for bone formation.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to talk about two experiments – the first is looking at the rate of phosphorylation (or how active) of two ALK2 mutants, L196P and R258S. The second is to look at mapping the exact sites of phosphorylation on two of the more common ALK2 mutations in FOP, R206H and Q027E.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phosphorylation over time in ALK2 L196P and R258S.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve talked <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/phosphorylation-of-smad1-rates-as-a-function-of-alk2-mutations-and-type-ii-association/">previously</a> about how phosphorylation is effected by the Q207E and R206H mutations in ALK2. This time I wanted to look at some additional mutants that are found in a small proportion of cases of FOP, specifically L196P, R258S, G328E and R375P. I purified the long forms of these ALK2 mutations in a standard fashion. Regrettably only L196P and R258S gave a good yield of expressed protein while the other two constructs gave me no expression of protein. I set up my standard activation assay with these ALK2 mutants (I mixed them with SMAD1 and with either ACVR2 or BMPR2, before adding ATP, DTT and Mg2+/Mn2+ in order to start the reaction), taking samples over time periodically up to 30 minutes. The samples were then analysed by mass spec to look for intact mass shifts corresponding to phosphorylation.</p>
<p>I plotted the peaks corresponding to phosphorylated states of both ALK2 and SMAD1 at the different time points and used this 3D graph to compare different mutant’s behaviour with respect to the activity of ALK2. I also compared this data to previously obtained data from the previous blog post.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2580" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-806x1024.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="991" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-236x300.jpg 236w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-768x975.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Time course plots for phosphorylation of SMAD1 (top) and ALK2 L196P or R258S (bottom) in the presence of ACVR2 (left) or BMPR2 (right). Legend shows time point in seconds.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall we can see that R258S appears to be more activating than L196P with both more SMAD activation over the first five minutes (including the appearance of a potentially interesting third SMAD binding site). This is the case when using either ACVR2 or BMPR2. Also in general ACVR2 appears to lead to more SMAD activation than BMPR2 regardless of mutation.</p>
<p>When looking at ALK2 phosphorylation, we can see that L196P is quickly phosphorylated up to three times compared to R258S but that over the course of five minutes, R258S accumulates up to 6 phosphorylation’s much more rapidly than L196P. This effect is most pronounced when paired with ACVR2.</p>
<p>What this means in very broad terms is that the different ALK2 FOP mutants are differently activating and that their response to different type II receptors change depending on which mutation is present. This is similar to the results seen with other ALK2 mutants studied previously. This builds towards understanding why the ALK2 FOP mutations leads to increased signalling and thus increased bone formation and exactly what is going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phosphomapping of ALK2 R206H and Q207E:</strong></p>
<p>Another aspect of looking at the phosphorylation of ALK2 and SMAD1 is not just how much it is phosphorylated but also where it is phosphorylated. For this I worked with Rod Chalk in our mass spec department to map the phosphorylation sites present in samples of protein incubated as previously mentioned. In this case I was looking at Q207E and R206H mutants of ALK2 paired with either ACVR2 or BMPR2, all in the presence of SMAD. This suggested that many of the phosphorylations could be traced to the following positions in the GS region of the kinase regardless of ALK2 mutation:</p>
<p><strong><u>ST</u></strong>LADLLDH<strong><u>S</u></strong>C<strong><u>TS</u></strong>G<strong><u>S</u></strong>G<strong><u>S</u></strong>GLPFLVQRTV</p>
<p>However not all these sites are seen at the same time and it is hard to determine which are essential for transmission of signal and ALK2 activation.</p>
<p>Similarly phosphorylation on SMAD1 could be traced to the following common locations at the C-terminal tail of the protein:</p>
<p>TQMGSPHNPI<strong><u>SS</u></strong>V<strong><u>S</u></strong></p>
<p>In this case it is the last three serines in the tail that are able to be phosphorylated and again, are seen with both mutations. Combinations of the three possible sites and all three at once were seen as possibilities within the phosphomapping data.</p>
<p>What this means however is a bit less clear. When considering the time course data from the previous post linked as well as the new mutant time course data and the phosphomapping it seems to suggest that you require multiple (up to 6) ALK2 phosphorylations to get maximal (3 site) SMAD1 phosphorylation and that there are at least this many sites in the GS loop and the region just prior to it.</p>
<p>In order to properly probe the necessity of each of these sites, it is going to be necessary to repeat these mass spec experiments on knock out mutants that remove the phosphorylation sites in various combinations, to really see which are essential for ALK2 activation. These are currently being cloned so hopefully I’ll be able to test them soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know as many as 30% of the cells in labs could be misidentified? And what a nightmare it would be to find out years of your work are just completely wrong because you got your skin cells mixed up with your brain cells&#8230;</p>
<p>So to avoid that catastrophe, I took some time to check the DNA sequence of the ACVR1 gene, because for this gene we know what should be mutated (or not) for each of my cell lines. This way I can make sure that I haven&#8217;t mixed them up in the past year (<em>and</em> that they haven&#8217;t picked up new mutations in this important area all by themselves).</p>
<p>All I had to do was collect the genomes of the cells, amplify specifically the ACVR1 gene, send it for overnight sequencing, and then I get a trace like this back from the facility:</p>
<div id="attachment_2544" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1.png"><img class="wp-image-2544 size-large" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-1024x396.png" alt="Sequencing trace covering the R206H mutation in ACVR1 found in FOP and DIPG" width="780" height="302" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-1024x396.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-300x116.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sequencing trace covering the R206H mutation in ACVR1 found in FOP and DIPG</p></div>
<p>Each DNA base has one peak, except one that has both a guanine (G) and an adenine (A) DNA base. The adenine, present on one chromosome, causes the change from an arginine (R) to a histidine (H) at the 206th position of the ACVR1 protein i.e. the R206H mutation.</p>
<p>This trace is from the HSJD-DIPG-007 cell line and is the mutation I expected. According to all my sequencing, none of my cell lines have gotten mixed up, yay!</p>
