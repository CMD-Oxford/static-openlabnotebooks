				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My main project resolves around the E3 ligase UBE3A (I will be writing a project overview for this later), but I am also continuing some work in the same vein as <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/past-scientist/jolene-ho/">Jolene Ho&#8217;s work</a> looking at role of HTT in neurological disorders.</p>
<p>HTT encodes a protein called huntingtin whose function is not known but appears to be crucial to neuron function.  Mutant HTT is frequently associated with Huntington&#8217;s Disease (HD), where the 5&#8242; end of the <em>HTT</em> gene is observed to have an expanded CAG repeat region &#8211; the trinucleotide is repeated more times in individuals with HD than in normal individuals. In HD, mutant HTT is observed to affect neuronal function and structure leading to progressive neurodegeneration, however the exact disease mechanism is not well understood.</p>
<p>To study the function of HTT and the effects of mutant HTT protein <em>in vivo</em>, I will try to introduce trackable copies of <em>HTT </em>into mammalian cells, specifically neuronal cells. By overexpressing the HTT protein in varying amounts and with varying number of CAG repeats, we can try to elucidate the normal function of HTT in a non-disease context and examine how mutant HTT protein affects cell function and leads to neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>As seen in <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/past-scientist/jolene-ho/">Jolene&#8217;s previous posts</a>, it is can be difficult to express such a large protein in cells. Jolene attempted to express HTT in <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/overexpression-of-expanded-htt-in-brain-cancer-cell-lines/">two brain cancer cell lines</a>, but found limited success. I am using the same <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/overexpressing-htt-in-mammalian-cells/">BacMAM virus system</a> previously established at the SGC and attempting to apply it in the widely used neuroblast cell line SH-SY5Y. The protocols for the experiments described below and additional data can be found on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3361015#.XUj8POhKiMo">Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>With limited examples of the use of BacMAM in SH-SY5Y in the literature, I decided to test a range of virus amounts and included a BacMAM GFP control which I could visualize under the microscope to see how effective it was in SH-SY5Y. In line with <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/overexpressing-htt-in-mammalian-cells/">Jolene&#8217;s optimization experiments</a> and a paper I found using BacMAM to overexpress wildtype and mutant LRRK2 implicated in Parkinson&#8217;s Disease  (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3429506/">22952710</a>), I used up to 25% v/v of p3 (passage 3) BacMAM virus to transduce SH-SY5Y and included HEK293 for comparison.</p>
<p>The LRRK2 article (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3429506/">22952710</a>) assayed cells for protein expression 48 hours post-transduction, so I thought I would get decent HTT expression within the same time-frame. I tracked GFP expression for 48 hours to get an overall idea of how effective the virus is in SH-SHY5. To detect HTT expression, I followed-up with FLAG-tag immunofluorescence (IF) in the SH-SY5Y (note: HEK293 don&#8217;t adhere very well and wash off easily so IF can&#8217;t be done with them). I find that GFP is very well expressed in both the HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines after 48hrs, however, I did not detect any FLAG-tagged HTT in my IF (see RFP signal in figure below). This suggest that expression levels of the FLAG-tagged HTT from my BacMAM virus is likely too low to be detected using IF.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-300x137.png" alt="" width="654" height="299" class="aligncenter wp-image-3285" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-300x137.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-768x350.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-1024x467.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /></p>
<p>I decided to repeat the transduction in a larger 24-well format and harvest cells for a western to see if I could detect any HTT expression. I also changed the harvest point to 3 days post-transduction as Jolene successfully in detected overexpressed HTT in HEK293 with a longer 3-day post-transduction expression period. I observed some SH-SHY5 cells began dying 2 days post-transduction, with more cells dying and lifting off in higher v/v of BacMAM virus. After 3 days, I was only able to harvest the cells with 5% BacMAM virus for my western as most of the cells at higher v/v BacMAM virus died.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-300x148.png" alt="" width="675" height="333" class="aligncenter wp-image-3284" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-300x148.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-768x379.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-1024x506.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></p>
<p>In my western, I detected FLAG-tagged HTT in the positive controls (D1 &#8211; 23 CAG repeats, D2 &#8211; 54 CAG repeats), but I did not detect any in both my SH-SY5Y grown for 3 days and 6 days post-transduction. It is possible that 5% v/v BacMAM virus is too low, but before I can move forward with higher v/v, I need to optimize conditions for the transduction in SH-SY5Y so that fewer cells die. The SH-SY5Y cells may be dying from either too much virus, the side effects of overexpressing HTT, or incompatibility with the Sf9 media the BacMAM virus is in. Moving forward, I will have to test these possibilities and optimize transduction conditions to maximize overexpression HTT while reducing cell death.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Anti-FLAG purification of the HTT C-HEAT domain. Eluted protein is seen in the red box!</p>
<p>This purification was first done by <a href="http://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a> (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XUQ4snspA2x">Zenodo</a>). Following her purification protocol, I obtained good yields of protein (0.45 mg of protein per L of Sp9 cells) which I immediately used to set crystal trays and to initiate biophysical characterization.</p>
<p>In future purifications, my aim is to improve purity as I noticed the sample was not very clean (low molecular weight proteins and nucleic acid). Further, I want to do a more stringent analysis to determine the most ideal buffer conditions for the sample using DSLS and DSF. I also would like to use SDS-PAGE and native PAGE to determine the progression of the limited proteolysis over time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I joined the group of Dr. Cheryl Arrowsmith 2 months ago. Currently, I am working on the Huntington’s disease project along with <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a> and <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/jacob-mcauley/">Jacob McAuley</a>. During these past two months, I have been learning how to purify huntingtin (HTT) protein and overall getting up to date with the project.</p>
<p>A brief introduction to the project: HTT is a 348 KDa protein that is vital for development <sup>1</sup>. HTT has a polyglutamine repeat at its N-terminus which is normally no longer than 35 repeats (Figure 1). When this number of repeats exceeds 38 repeats, it causes Huntington’s disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurological disorder that occurs in adulthood and sometimes in children <sup>2</sup>. Thus, like many other neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, HD is also caused by a protein with an abnormal function in the cell. There are very limited treatments available for HD patients in part because there is little information about the function and structure of HTT and mutant HTT.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Project-overview-post_3-284x300.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3227" width="284" height="300" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Project-overview-post_3-284x300.jpg 284w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Project-overview-post_3.jpg 718w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. The huntingtin protein in normal population and in Huntington&#8217;s disease patients. Figure courtesy of <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>.</p>
<p>In the cell, HTT is thought to be involved in several important protein-protein interactions that are critical for cellular vesicular transport, endocytosis, autophagy and the regulation of transcription <sup>3,7</sup>. However, the complete picture of the function of HTT in the cell is yet not fully determined.</p>
<p>HTT is made up of three different domains. Two HEAT <sup>8,9</sup> (<u>H</u>untingtin, <u>E</u>longation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2<u>A</u>, <u>T</u>arget of rapamycin 1) domains at the N-terminus and C-terminus which are connected by a bridge. However, HTT has several disordered regions within these domains, which makes structural studies of HTT challenging. Recently, the cryo-EM structure of the protein was obtained making a huge step forward to understand more about HTT <sup>10</sup>. However, almost a quarter of the structure of HTT is still unknown in part due to the dynamic nature of this protein.</p>
<p>The main focus of my project is to obtain the 3D structure of the individual domains of the HTT protein, namely the N-terminal HEAT domain, the bridge and C-terminal HEAT domain. With this approach, we hope to better define structural elements in the protein. Further, studies with the individual domains will also be useful to understand what the role of each of the domains is within HTT. By learning about the structure and function of the individual domains, we can learn about HTT’s function inside the cell. I will be posting updates on the research progress so stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are getting close to the midpoint of the summer and my project is well underway. With another week passed, I have more purifications to share. Again, I was attempting to purify proteins we think might interact with the huntingtin protein in neuronal cells. This time around was a little less successful than previous posts, with the attempted purification of <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P61086">UBE2K</a>, <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P54257">HAP1</a>, and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96PU5">NEDD4L</a>; sadly, only UBE2K was able to be successfully purified. These purifications followed the same general procedure that was detailed in<a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/production-and-purification-of-huntingtin-interaction-partners-continued/"> last week’s post</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the summer continues to progress, so does my project. After the last round of purification, detailed in my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/first-round-of-huntingtin-interaction-partner-protein-production/">previous blog post</a>, I am ready for another round. During this purification, I will be working with <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BY11">SH3G3</a> and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99963">PACN1</a>. PACN1 is responsible for cytoskeletal remodeling through regulation of several other proteins, as well as neuronal vesicle endocytosis, among other things. It is thought that SH3G3 is more specialized in aiding endocytosis. Luckily, the purification of both proteins was successful, although that’s not to say everything went to plan.</p>
<p>The tags on these proteins allowed for multiple possible binding possibilities, meaning we had different avenues we could try for the purification. In the first attempt, we used SBP resin. In theory, the SBP would bind our protein of interest, allowing us to purify it, but in practice, the binding affinity was disappointingly low. In an attempt to salvage the purification, we then ran through a nickel purification, reverse nickel purification and size exclusion chromatography. Because of the design of the tag, our protein binds Nickel, but some proteins that occur naturally will also bind Nickel, so after collecting all of the nickel binding proteins, we can cut off the tag on our protein, using TEV, leaving it unable to bind Nickel. This means that is we mix nickel resin with the proteins; everything should bind the Nickel except our protein. After this, we ran it through a column with gel beads that contain tiny pores. Small proteins get trapped in the pores while larger proteins glide through, this gives us an additional way to purify our protein. For complete methods and data for <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3256579#.XRJllIhKjcs">SH3G3</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3256589#.XRJlr4hKjcs">PACN1</a> purifications, look to my posts on Zenodo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To start off my project at the SGC, my supervisor, <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>, and I produced and purified three proteins. These proteins were <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9H0U4">RAB1A</a>, <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P62820">RAB1B</a>, and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P51608">MECP2</a>. Both RAB1A and RAB1B have functions in the initiation of autophagy, which is a cellular system that helps clean out old debris and malfunctioning parts. MECP2 is a protein that can interact with DNA, changing the levels of expression of several genes. The purifications of RAB1A and RAB1B were successful, although MECP2 could not be adequately purified. These three proteins were hits with the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234159#.XP7Go4hKjcs">BioID experiment</a> I mentioned in my<a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/project-overview-huntingtin-and-its-interaction-partners/"> previous post</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, we took <em>E. coli</em> cells and transformed them with plasmid DNA. The transformation process introduces the bacteria to the genetic instructions on how to make the protein, the cells were left to grow for about 24 hours. By the end, we had 6 L of liquid culture for both RAB1A and RAB1B as well as 4 L of MECP2. From this liquid culture, we collected the cells and proceeded to break them open using sound energy via a process called sonication. After opening the cells, we were able to purify our protein using two methods. The first was affinity chromatography, which allows the binding of a specific tag we put on our protein. To further refine the protein sample, we used size-exclusion chromatography, which is a process that separates proteins based on their size. For a more in-depth explanation of the methods used to purify <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3252165#.XQ00qIhKjcs">RAB1A</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3252174#.XQ00k4hKjcs">RAB1B</a>, and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3252176#.XQ0z74hKjcs">MECP2</a>, follow the links to the Zenodo posts about each protein.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene which encodes for the huntingtin protein. The current understanding of the function of HTT is limited, and there are only a few sources that indicate that it likely plays a critical role in several intracellular processes such as proper neural development. This gap in the scientific literature continues onto the mutant version of the protein. In patients with HD, we know that the mutant protein misfolds and forms aggregates. However, it is unclear if this is the direct cause for the symptoms of the disease or if it is a downstream symptom of some other problem. To obtain a more conclusive understanding of huntingtins role in the cell, the SGC is trying to obtain a structure for huntingtin protein.<br />
So now the question is, how do we image such a molecule? At the SGC we use a technique called X-ray Crystallography. This is a process by which a very pure protein sample is crystallized and expose to X-rays. Using the diffraction of light through the crystal, we can piece together an atom by atom computer model of the sample protein. One complication with the huntingtin protein is that it contains several disordered regions which would likely prevent the formation of a consistent structure in the crystal. To get a full image of this protein, we need to find a way to force a consistent structure onto the disordered regions. Binding a protein to the disordered region causes consistent reordering of this region. The use of a <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234159#.XP5doIhKjcs">BioID experiment</a> has identified several proteins that bind huntingtin. In effect, this experiment consists of arming the huntingtin protein with a spray can. When another protein comes within its vicinity, it is tagged by the huntingtin molecule. By looking at tagged proteins, several interaction partners of huntingtin were identified.<br />
During my time at the SGC, I plan to go through this list of tentative interaction partners, producing and purifying them for use in future experiments. Furthermore, this could allow us to obtain crystal structures of huntingtin in complex with an interaction partner. Obtaining a list of all the interaction partners of any given protein can give us a good idea of the function of the protein. This is because we can then attribute the interaction partners function to that of the protein of interest. In the coming weeks, I will continue to post updates on the progress of the purification of the hits from the BioID experiment.</p>
