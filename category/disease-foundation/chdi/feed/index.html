Again, I was attempting to purify proteins we think might interact with the huntingtin protein in neuronal cells. This time around was a little less successful than previous posts, with the attempted purification of <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P61086">UBE2K</a>, <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P54257">HAP1</a>, and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96PU5">NEDD4L</a>; sadly, only UBE2K was able to be successfully purified. These purifications followed the same general procedure that was detailed in<a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/production-and-purification-of-huntingtin-interaction-partners-continued/"> last week’s post</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the summer continues to progress, so does my project. After the last round of purification, detailed in my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/first-round-of-huntingtin-interaction-partner-protein-production/">previous blog post</a>, I am ready for another round. During this purification, I will be working with <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BY11">SH3G3</a> and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99963">PACN1</a>. PACN1 is responsible for cytoskeletal remodeling through regulation of several other proteins, as well as neuronal vesicle endocytosis, among other things. It is thought that SH3G3 is more specialized in aiding endocytosis. Luckily, the purification of both proteins was successful, although that’s not to say everything went to plan.</p>
<p>The tags on these proteins allowed for multiple possible binding possibilities, meaning we had different avenues we could try for the purification. In the first attempt, we used SBP resin. In theory, the SBP would bind our protein of interest, allowing us to purify it, but in practice, the binding affinity was disappointingly low. In an attempt to salvage the purification, we then ran through a nickel purification, reverse nickel purification and size exclusion chromatography. Because of the design of the tag, our protein binds Nickel, but some proteins that occur naturally will also bind Nickel, so after collecting all of the nickel binding proteins, we can cut off the tag on our protein, using TEV, leaving it unable to bind Nickel. This means that is we mix nickel resin with the proteins; everything should bind the Nickel except our protein. After this, we ran it through a column with gel beads that contain tiny pores. Small proteins get trapped in the pores while larger proteins glide through, this gives us an additional way to purify our protein. For complete methods and data for <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3256579#.XRJllIhKjcs">SH3G3</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3256589#.XRJlr4hKjcs">PACN1</a> purifications, look to my posts on Zenodo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To start off my project at the SGC, my supervisor, <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>, and I produced and purified three proteins. These proteins were <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9H0U4">RAB1A</a>, <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P62820">RAB1B</a>, and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P51608">MECP2</a>. Both RAB1A and RAB1B have functions in the initiation of autophagy, which is a cellular system that helps clean out old debris and malfunctioning parts. MECP2 is a protein that can interact with DNA, changing the levels of expression of several genes. The purifications of RAB1A and RAB1B were successful, although MECP2 could not be adequately purified. These three proteins were hits with the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234159#.XP7Go4hKjcs">BioID experiment</a> I mentioned in my<a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/project-overview-huntingtin-and-its-interaction-partners/"> previous post</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, we took <em>E. coli</em> cells and transformed them with plasmid DNA. The transformation process introduces the bacteria to the genetic instructions on how to make the protein, the cells were left to grow for about 24 hours. By the end, we had 6 L of liquid culture for both RAB1A and RAB1B as well as 4 L of MECP2. From this liquid culture, we collected the cells and proceeded to break them open using sound energy via a process called sonication. After opening the cells, we were able to purify our protein using two methods. The first was affinity chromatography, which allows the binding of a specific tag we put on our protein. To further refine the protein sample, we used size-exclusion chromatography, which is a process that separates proteins based on their size. For a more in-depth explanation of the methods used to purify <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3252165#.XQ00qIhKjcs">RAB1A</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3252174#.XQ00k4hKjcs">RAB1B</a>, and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3252176#.XQ0z74hKjcs">MECP2</a>, follow the links to the Zenodo posts about each protein.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene which encodes for the huntingtin protein. The current understanding of the function of HTT is limited, and there are only a few sources that indicate that it likely plays a critical role in several intracellular processes such as proper neural development. This gap in the scientific literature continues onto the mutant version of the protein. In patients with HD, we know that the mutant protein misfolds and forms aggregates. However, it is unclear if this is the direct cause for the symptoms of the disease or if it is a downstream symptom of some other problem. To obtain a more conclusive understanding of huntingtins role in the cell, the SGC is trying to obtain a structure for huntingtin protein.<br />
So now the question is, how do we image such a molecule? At the SGC we use a technique called X-ray Crystallography. This is a process by which a very pure protein sample is crystallized and expose to X-rays. Using the diffraction of light through the crystal, we can piece together an atom by atom computer model of the sample protein. One complication with the huntingtin protein is that it contains several disordered regions which would likely prevent the formation of a consistent structure in the crystal. To get a full image of this protein, we need to find a way to force a consistent structure onto the disordered regions. Binding a protein to the disordered region causes consistent reordering of this region. The use of a <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234159#.XP5doIhKjcs">BioID experiment</a> has identified several proteins that bind huntingtin. In effect, this experiment consists of arming the huntingtin protein with a spray can. When another protein comes within its vicinity, it is tagged by the huntingtin molecule. By looking at tagged proteins, several interaction partners of huntingtin were identified.<br />
During my time at the SGC, I plan to go through this list of tentative interaction partners, producing and purifying them for use in future experiments. Furthermore, this could allow us to obtain crystal structures of huntingtin in complex with an interaction partner. Obtaining a list of all the interaction partners of any given protein can give us a good idea of the function of the protein. This is because we can then attribute the interaction partners function to that of the protein of interest. In the coming weeks, I will continue to post updates on the progress of the purification of the hits from the BioID experiment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been busy in the lab working at the bench and training our new recruits to the Huntington’s disease research team! Welcome Jacob and Claudia!</p>
<p>Using a technique called <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234159">BioID</a>, we have identified proteins which are proximal or nearby to the HTT protein in cells. To date, no published literature details the use of this methodology to identify proteins which might interact with HTT so this represents a novel approach. Working in collaboration with Prof. Anne-Claude Gingras (Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, University of Toronto) and her postdoctoral fellow Dr. Geoff Hesketh, we have used this technique to finalise a short-list of supposed HTT interacting proteins, many of which are newly described in their connection to Huntington’s disease. This is an exciting step forward to this project and I am keen to follow up all of these new leads.</p>
<p>Working in collaboration with Prof. Hilal Lashuel and Driss Boudeffa as well as our cryoEM collaborators Prof. Susan Lea and Dr. Justin Deme, we have analysed how altering the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234163">phosphorylation state of HTT might change the global structure</a>. We analysed our dephosphorylated samples by cryoEM and we can see the global structure of the protein from <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234167">analysis of the images</a> collected by Susan and Justin. I am looking forward to their next update on the remaining samples.</p>
<p>The stringent protein purification protocol for HTT is now <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234174">optimised</a> and we used this to purify both <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234182">HTT and HTT-HAP40 Q23</a> . These samples are ready for analysis and use in different interaction studies.</p>
<p>I am away from the lab for the next few weeks as I will be travelling to Europe to attend the <a href="https://www.grc.org/cag-triplet-repeat-disorders-conference/2019/">Gordon Research Conference on Triplet Repeat Disorders in Italy</a>. I am excited to give my talk and present my poster as well as catch up with many of my HD colleagues and collaborators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has now been almost 2 years since I set out to try and make fragments of the huntingtin protein which might be amenable to structural analysis with X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a fantastic method and allows us to see the molecules in very fine atomic detail which is important if we are to understand the intricacies of the elusive huntingtin protein molecule. It has been a long hard road with almost none of our extensive cloning efforts producing any expression constructs which made sufficient yields of protein. X-ray crystallography is a protein-expensive method so we need milligram (lots of protein). But finally, I have purified milligrams of different huntingtin fragment protein samples!!!</p>
<p>It should be made very clear that this has been a big team effort with cloner extraordinaire, Peter Loppnau, the eukaryotic production, Ashley Hutchinson and Alma Seitova as well as Linda Lin doing a lot of the heavy lifting on our cloning and eukaryotic production pipeline so I am very grateful for all of their hard work. Turns out that my construct design was fine but the expression vector we used made a huge difference (this is the piece of DNA which we insert different parts of the huntingtin gene). Switching from pFBOH-MHL to pBMDEL gave us great yields! Here is the C-terminal HEAT domain protein I purified &#8211; so much pure protein! All of the other data can be found on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060">Zenodo</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2707" style="width: 999px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-2707 size-full" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/C-term_large-scale_20190404.png" alt="" width="989" height="908" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/C-term_large-scale_20190404.png 989w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/C-term_large-scale_20190404-300x275.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/C-term_large-scale_20190404-768x705.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The gel filtration fractions were run on the gel before I had measured protein concentration – there is too much sample on the gel, but it looks great!</p></div>
<p>I have also been working to make the cleanest possible sample of the HTT-HAP40 protein complex &#8211; all data are on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628064">Zenodo</a>. Having very clean samples should reduce prep-to-prep variation and reduce contamination of pesky proteins which are not either HTT or HAP40 in the sample. However, there is a trade off; more purification steps are needed to make a very pure sample but for every additional step the yield will decrease so I end up with less final material. However, I am very pleased with this sample (tempted to say cleanest prep ever?!).</p>
