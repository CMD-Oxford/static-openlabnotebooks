				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the second purification round of <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3562523#.XeflbdVOnb0">N-HEAT_81-1643</a>, I added an additional purification step with heparin resin. My aim with doing this additional step was to improve the purity of the HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 sample from nucleic acid material/other proteins. Similar experiments proved successful for full HTT+HAP40 sample (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234174#.Xefm19VOnb0">by Dr. Rachel Harding</a>). Our results showed that the additional step with heparin does not change the purity, oligomeric state, or the content of nucleic acid in the sample of N-HEAT_81-1643  (A<sub>260/280 </sub>=  0.7).</p>
<p>I also performed DSF, DSLS and DLS experiments with HTT N-HEAT_81-1643. The DSLS experiments show the construct aggregates at high temperatures around 80 °C. The DSF experiments showed the construct has a melting temperature around 46 °C. No significant difference in the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) or temperature of aggregation (T<sub>agg</sub>) was observed in the two buffer systems or protein concentrations tested.</p>
<p>The DLS experiments show that the HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 particles in solution have a radius of around 15 nm, implying the presence of large particles. These results are consistent with gel filtration chromatography results, which show N-HEAT_81-1643 elutes as a very large particle in solution (early elution volume). However, there is still the possibility that the construct HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 is in an extended conformation or in complex with nucleic acid material, which would also result in large particle size readings by DLS and gel filtration chromatography. So, in future experiments we will run negative stain experiments, which will tell us more about the conformation/oligomeric state of the sample.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/project-overview-overexpressing-htt-in-neuronal-cells/">last blog post</a>, I described how I am trying to overexpress HTT in neuronal cells. While the BacMAM system was easy to implement in cells such as HEK293, it proved far more challenging to express in SH-SH5Y neuronal cells. Since then, I have attempted to use the BacMAM system in two other neuronal cell lines, Neuro-2a and N38. However, I found that even the positive control GFP-BacMAM was low expressing and thus the lines were not very promising for HTT expression (data not shown). These results were disheartening so I began exploring alternative means of expressing HTT in cells, including protein transfection and protein electroporation. The methods described in this post can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3546328">Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>I tested protein transfection using HEPES as a DIY protein transfection reagent following protocols from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6357789/">PMC6357789</a>. Jacob McAuley <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/final-purifications/">purified some GFP protein</a> for me to use as a test protein. HTT is a far larger protein so I rationalized that if the method did not even work for GFP, it was unlikely to work with HTT which was both larger and cannot be concentrated to the same high level as GFP. The HEPES transfection did not work in HEK293, Neuro-2a, N38 and SH-SH5Y cells, with no discernible amount of GFP detected on a fluorescent microscope in all four cell lines (data not shown).</p>
<p>Electroporation has also been reported to successfully deliver proteins into cells. Using the methods from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656429/">PMC6656429</a>, and conditions from the <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/content/dam/LifeTech/migration/en/filelibrary/cell-culture/neon-protocols.par.61129.file.dat/hek%20293-kidney.pdf">manufacturer</a>, I began with electroporating some HEK293 cells with GFP protein to identify conditions where I got the highest level of protein electroporation and sufficiently high viability post-electroporation. I was able to successful electroporate in the GFP protein (Figure 1). I noted that the protein electroporation is most successful with higher levels of protein concentration and with post-electroporation treatment of cells with trypsin. Alas, when I tried this method with HTT, I was not able to get measurable HTT signal by Western blot (Figure 2). This is likely because HTT is a protein that is difficult to concentrated to levels higher than 4mg/ml. While the method did not work for this specific application, it does offer a useful approach to introduce difficult to express proteins into cells and examine how they behave within cells. Antibodies can also be introduced into cells in this manner, as well as sgRNAs/cas9 protein for cell engineering.</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to go back to the BacMAM system in SH-SY5Y cells and spend some time tweaking the cell culture media and timing of the transduction to improve BacMAM HTT expression. In my last post, I observed that SH-SHY5 cells began dying 2 days post-transduction and that more cells died in higher v/v BacMAM virus. Some possible causes included the SH-SY5Y cells may be dying from either too much virus, the side effects of overexpressing HTT, or incompatibility with the Sf9 media the BacMAM virus is in. I noted that with greater v/v BacMAM virus, the SH-SY5Y cell media was acidifying more quickly, and I hypothesized that this may be because the sf9 media is incompatible with the cells. I scoured the internet looking for advice on what SH-SY5Y media modifications I can make to improve cell growth. Most publications refer to standard growth media conditions identical to my own, but after investigation into the exact formulation of some medias used, I noticed that some contained higher levels of sodium bicarbonate, which is used as part of the CO<sub>2 </sub>buffering system.</p>
<p>Using modified SH-SY5Y media with a higher percentage of FBS (15%) and supplemented with B27, non-essential amino acids and additional sodium bicarbonate, I was able to successfully express HTT in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 3). Overall, I observe that there is a trade-off between increased HTT expression and cell death with higher v/v BacMAM virus levels or longer transduction times. Moving forward, I will need to optimize these parameters to get the highest HTT expression with lowest SH-SY5Y cell death. I also want to attempt to express other HTT mutant forms with varying number of CAG repeats.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five months ago, I made my first post outlining the goals of my project here at the SGC. I am writing again today to update you on the progress I have made toward those goals. As a brief overview, I was working on finding Huntingtin (HTT) interacting proteins, but why would this be important? If you’ve read any of my previous posts, you will know that a mutation in HTT causes Huntington’s Disease (HD), a progressive neurological disorder. You will also know that there are currently no therapies for this debilitating disease, in large part due to our lack of understanding of how HTT functions, or how this might be perturbed when HTT is mutated. A hugely impactful tool for understanding a protein’s function is to understand the structure. This is what initially kicked off the HTT project at the SGC, but since the project’s inception, there have been a few roadblocks. Due to the inherent nature of HTT, it is not easily imaged. HTT can be broken into 3 main domains, the C-terminal, N-terminal, and Bridge domains. The C-HEAT domain is quite mobile with respect to the other domains, which is very problematic for current imaging techniques which are hampered in their ability to resolve conformationally heterogeneous protein samples. Recently, another protein, called HAP40, was found to bind HTT. This protein seemed to lock HTT into a single conformation allowing for the first structure of HTT to be produced. Although this is a significant first step, this structure only represents about 75% of the protein. My goal this summer was to find proteins that can function similar to HAP40 in locking HTT into a single conformation, but for more localized structures that were missed in this structure mentioned above. To do this, the SGC compiled a list of possible interaction partners. This list was formed from previous databases from the CHDI, a literature review, and a BioID experiment. For the majority of the summer, I was devoted to producing as many of these constructs as I could. From a list of 118, 17 were produced, and 9 of those were produced at sufficient quantity and purity to be used for interaction experiments. More specific methods for the purification of these proteins can be found at this link: <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/jacobmcauley_summer2019/?page=1&amp;size=20">link</a>.</p>
<p>The general procedure used to assess binding was based on a simple pull-down. The construct of HTT used during these sets of experiments was representative of mutant HTT with an extended polyQ length of 54. This protein was copurified with HAP40. Both HAP40 and HTT had tags helpful for purification, those being FLAG and His-Tags, respectively. By mixing the possible interaction partner with HTT and then pulling down HTT via the tags, we would expect to see the interaction partner to be pulled down as well if they are, in fact, interacting in a sufficiently tight manner to stay together during this process. Sadly, during the preliminary screening, I was able to do, there were no signs of interaction by this method. This, however, is not a conclusive result. So many factors affect interactions. It is possible that the movement of a tag or a change of buffer conditions could completely change the results we observed, so there is still lots of work to be done on this. It is very possible that HTT interacts with many proteins through weak and transient interactions which would be difficult to capture by many biophysical methods. For the screens that have been completed so far, there is a link here to the exact methods used: <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3515479#.Xa4psOhKjD4">link</a> . I, unfortunately, will not be continuing with these trials, but with a continued effort toward this project, I have hope that this will aid in our understanding of HTT.</p>

I have been busy in the lab trying to isolate monomeric and stable samples of the N-HEAT domain just as we demonstrated with the <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/purification-of-the-htt-c-heat-domain/">C-HEAT</a> domain (and by <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XYzlUmYpDb0">Dr. Rachel Harding)</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I summarize the results of the first round of purification of the huntingtin N-HEAT domain with boundaries 81-1643 (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3462496#.XYzkY2YpDb0">HTT N-HEAT_81-1643</a>).</p>
<p>The construct HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 encompasses the entire N &#8211; terminal HEAT domain (all 21 HEAT repeats) (Figure 1). This construct and a few others N-HEAT constructs (which I will be posting about later) were selected among several N-HEAT constructs initially made due to high levels of expression in Sf9 cells (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2600051#.XKU89aeZPOQ">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>). The first large scale purification of HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 showed this construct elutes early from the Superdex 200 10/300 column (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XULMtnspDb0">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>). This implied the construct was either in a high oligomeric state or an extended conformation.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Hunting structure (PDB 6ez8)<sup>1</sup>. N-HEAT (91-1641) colored in cyan</p>
<p>In <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3462496#.XYzkY2YpDb0">this purification</a>, I used a different gel filtration column (Superpose 6 10/300) which has a broader fractionation range of MW weights than the Superdex 200 column used initially. By using this column, I could better idea of the particle size of HTT N-HEAT construct. The results from this purification showed the construct also eluted early from the Superose 6 column (MW ~670 KDa- according to protein standards). Note that, if the construct was a monomer and had globular shape, it should a elute at a volume of around 16 &#8211; 17 mL (the monomer = 172 KDa). The gel filtration results imply that the construct is in a high oligomeric state likely a tetramer. However, it is still also possible that the construct is in an extended conformation and this would also result in an early elution volume from the gel filtration column (large hydrodynamic ratio). Yet another possible explanation is that HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 is in a complex with nucleic acid material as final A<sub>260/280</sub> readings of the purified samples of the HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 show high content of nucleic acid material (A<sub>260/280</sub> = 0.7). Future experiments with this HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 will aim at testing these hypotheses.</p>

<p>The sample that was obtained from this purification was used to set crystal trays and to test sample stability. To date, no crystals have been observed in any of the trays set for this construct. Regarding the sample stability, the samples are easily degraded at 4 °C in comparison with the <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/purification-of-the-htt-c-heat-domain/">C-HEAT</a> domain.</p>

<p>One of the major findings of the HDSA-funded project to find huntingtin interactors relevant DNA repair was that many proteins that interact with huntingtin are modified by poly ADP ribose (PAR). Previous posts have described our <a href="https://raytruantlab.ca/2018/07/23/a-closer-look-at-the-hits-generates-2-new-hypotheses/">hypothesis that huntingtin binds poly ADP ribose,</a> our <a href="https://raytruantlab.ca/2018/09/07/is-huntingtin-a-par-binding-protein/">preliminary evidence that it does so</a>, <a href="https://raytruantlab.ca/2019/04/01/why-the-heck-does-huntingtin-bind-par/">frustrating attempts to understand why it does so</a>, and <a href="https://raytruantlab.ca/2019/07/15/huntingtin-chromatin-retention-in-parp-knockout-cells/">other confounding results</a>.</p>
<p>I wish this post was about a major breakthrough clarifying everything… but it’s just another normal, incremental piece of the puzzle (aka: science).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back again. Two posts in one month! I know its crazy, but I’m just excited to tell you about the progress that is being made on this project. First things first, purifications. This week I have four more to tell you about.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3380341#.XWakIehKjcs">GFP</a>, and unlike all of my other posts, this is not because it interacts with HTT. At the moment we are trying to over express FLAG-Tagged HTT in a neuronal cell line. Growing tagged HTT is usually done in HEK293 cells although this isn&#8217;t a great cell line for physiological studies of HTT due to its improper localization. Neurons are quite a bit more sensitive, so extra care has to be taken to properly over-express this protein. Using conventional methods of over expression don’t really work due to the physical characteristics of tagged HTT, mainly its size. To get the protein into the cell we are considering following the example of Lambert, H.<em> et. al.(</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1139/o90-105"><em>https://doi.org/10.1139/o90-105</em></a><em>). </em>Described in this paper, is a method of electroporating cells to insert protein into the cell instead of DNA to express said protein. The GFP will be used as an optimization tool to ensure our electroporation method can successfully insert a protein into a neuronal cell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other proteins that were purified pertained to my main project. They were P97, PIAS1, GIT1 and SP1. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3367290#.XWaj9OhKjcs">P97</a> was purified successfully resulting in a final yield of approximately 3 mg. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3380355#.XWajz-hKjcs">PIAS1</a> was unable to be successfully purified. Previously a shorter construct of PIAS1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 codon plus RIL but now we attempted an SF9 construct of full length PIAS1, although it seemed to have very poor expression in this system. GIT1 and SP1 were also unsuccessfully purified. As always, more detailed methods of purification can be found on Zenodo, any of the hyperlinks of the proteins will bring you to the respective Zenodo post.</p>
