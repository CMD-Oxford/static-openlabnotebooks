				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea for split-intein based SCN1A reconstitution started when I first learned of the split-Cas9 system. Long story short, packaging Cas9 with a guideRNA sequence into an AAV vector is pushing the packaging capacity of AAV vector. To circumvent this issue, the authors design a split-Cas9 system where the coding sequence for Cas9 is split into two fragments, each fused to a split-inteins sequence. When co-expressed in cells, the split-inteins can function as glue joining two protein fragments together.</p>
<p>In an attempt to “shrink” SCN1A to be packageable in AAV vectors, I ran into several design and cloning issues, ultimately leading to the decision to terminate this project. Cas9 is a well-studied cytoplasmic protein with structural information while SCN1A is a large multi-pass transmembrane protein that weaves in and out of the plasma membrane. While success packaging and application of the split-Cas9 system for gene editing is encouraging, my attempt to translate similar design to SCN1A, without structural information, proves to be an oversight. Design aside, the coding sequence for human SCN1A is difficult to maintain. The SCN1A cDNA sequence tends to accumulate deletions and rearranges when transformed and propagated in E. coli. One way to improve plasmid stability and reduce unwanted rearrangement is by propagating plasmid in E. coli strains with recA1 genotype at room temperature. recA1 confers a loss of function in RecA1, a protein that is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair in E. coli. While this strategy helps to alleviate the problem, it is time-consuming and eventually, I decided to make use of a codon-optimized human SCN1A cDNA as the cloning template for split-SCN1A constructs. While this solves the plasmid stability issue, the codon-optimized cDNA has not been well characterized and while the proteins expressed reconstituted, they failed to traffic to the correct cellular compartment. These raise an issue that needs to be addressed – how to propagate mutation-free gene therapy vectors with SCN1A sequence in large scale, have any of us managed to move the project to treatment pipeline.</p>
<p>Thank you all for reading. While this project didn&#8217;t work out as planned, I truly believe that this is an exciting time for Dravet Syndrome. With recent positive Fenfluramine clinical trial results, exciting new drugs in the pipeline, and cross-continental efforts in pushing various gene therapy approaches for treating Dravet, I am hopeful that we can see these exciting results moving into medical treatment in the foreseeable future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last posts, I have constructed a pair of split-SCN1A constructs (split- SCN1A-GFP<sub>(1-10)</sub> and SCN1A-GFP<sub>(11)</sub>). Here, I tested the functionality of these constructs by looking at whether these split- constructs reconstitute into a full-length SCN1A and generate a fluorescent signal when co-transfected in HEK293 cells, and if so, do the reconstituted SCN1A (with an internal GFP tag) localize correctly at the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Below are my imaging results. The detailed experimental procedure can be found at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1490851#.W_G_bpNKh3g">https://zenodo.org/record/1490851#.W_G_bpNKh3g</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, these split-constructs managed to find each other and reconstitute a GFP signal in HEK293 cells. However, the GFP signals do not overlap with cell cortex or plasma membrane markers (cell cortex marked by cortical actin staining and plasma membrane marked by CD8, a transmembrane glycoprotein.) The distribution of reconstituted SCN1A-GFP signals resembles misfolded proteins that are trapped in the ER.  Co-expression of SCN1B, a beta subunit which is thought to promote sodium channel trafficking, does not seem to improve the localization of reconstituted SCN1A-GFP.</p>
<p>There are several caveats with the design of these constructs which might have affected folding and trafficking of reconstituted SCN1A: 1) instead of using the canonical SCN1A cDNA sequence (which is  unstable and prone to mutagenize when propagated in E. coli), a codon-optimized SCN1A cDNA was used as a template in cloning these constructs and 2) the reconstituted protein has a foreign GFP sequence which might have interfered with SCN1A trafficking. Moving forward, I will revisit and examine the localization of codon optimized SCN1A in HEK293 cells while continue constructing the rest of the split-intein constructs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Previously, I provided a brief overview on SCN1A related Dravet Syndrome (DS) and the need for larger gene therapy vectors or alternative methods to deliver functional copies of SCN1A to affected cells in DS. The goal of my project is to explore one of these alternative methods, specifically a split-intein mediated protein trans-splicing method, that could reduce the size of the passenger (SCN1A expression cassettes) for gene therapy vectors. In this post, I will talk about the overall design for this method.</p>
<p>To give you a little more background about inteins: Inteins (also known as intervening proteins) are basically mobile protein elements that are translated and embedded within another protein sequences. You can think of them as single-use, single-turnover enzymes that catalyze their own excision from a flanking precursor “exteins” protein sequences while concurrently joining the remaining exteins protein fragments together through the formation of a new peptide bond (Fig. 1).</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2048 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/intein-inbase-300x185.png" alt="" width="300" height="185" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/intein-inbase-300x185.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/intein-inbase.png 736w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1. Intein-mediated protein splicing vs. RNA splicing.  Image source: Perler, F. B. (2002). InBase, the Intein Database. Nucleic Acids Res. 30, 383-384.</p>
<p>There are two types of inteins – cis splicing inteins that are embedded within protein sequences and catalyze protein splicing <em>in cis</em> and split- or trans-splicing inteins where the enzyme is naturally split and expressed into two parts. These two fragments of split-intein can associate with each other to form a catalytic active enzyme that can catalyze protein splicing <em>in trans. </em>Briefly, my project aims to split the SCN1A expression cassette into two parts and make use of the unique split-intein mediated trans-splicing capability to rejoin the expressed SCN1A fragments together (Fig. 2)</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2050 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dravet-pic4-216x300.png" alt="" width="216" height="300" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dravet-pic4-216x300.png 216w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dravet-pic4.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2. A basic design of split-intein mediated SCN1A protein trans-splicing</p>
<p>So, here goes the basic components and design of this cloning experiment. We are going to express SCN1A as two protein fragments (split-N terminal and split-C terminal SCN1A), each fused with split-N-term and C-term intein sequence (Fig. 2), respectively.</p>
<p>But&#8230; where do we split the protein?</p>
<p>One of the factors taken into consideration in designing the split sites is that for efficient protein trans-splicing, the split sites or the sites where split-intein sequences are inserted need to be surface exposed. SCN1A is a multipass membrane proteins with four homologous (unexposed) transmembrane domains (DI to DIV), each domain is connected to the next domain by large cytoplasmic loops (Fig. 3). In fulfilling this condition, we are left with the N and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and the cytoplasmic loops connecting DI to DII, DII to DIII, and DIII to DIV to work with. Among these cytoplasmic regions, splitting cytoplasmic loops within and between DII to DIII can result in a significant reduction in the size of SCN1A expression cassettes.</p>
<p>Additionally, to initiate efficient splicing reaction, split-inteins require a certain combination of amino acids flanking the intein sequences. For instance, split DnaB intein from <em>Synechocystis</em> needs to be flanked by a glycine at the N-terminus of the intein and a serine at C-terminus of the intein to catalyze protein trans-splicing whereas Vma intein from <em>S. cerevisiae </em>requires a glycine and cysteine amino acids combination.  In addition to previous considerations, these specific requirements of amino acids combinations for efficient and seamless protein trans-splicing helped us further narrow down a short list of potential SCN1A split sites.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2051 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scn1a-300x134.png" alt="" width="300" height="134" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scn1a-300x134.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scn1a-768x342.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scn1a-1024x456.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scn1a.png 1488w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we tell whether two split-SCN1A fragments trans-spliced?</p>
<p>To screen and identify constructs that have successfully reconstituted, I will attach split-GFP sequences to the N and C termini of the split-N-terminal-SCN1A intein and split-C-terminal-SCN1A-intein, respectively. Split-GFP is composed of two complementing split fluorescent protein fragments that irreversibly associate with each other to generate a fluorescent signal. When expressing both of these constructs in cells, we predicted that the split-GFP sequence would help bring the two split-proteins together (Fig. 4.) The split-intein would interact with each other to form an active enzyme and catalyze the excision of both itself and GFP protein to the cytoplasm. In addition to using the cytoplasmic GFP signal as a visual positive marker for trans-splicing, the split-GFP system could also be utilized as an alternative way to link two SCN1A fragments together.</p>
<p>So far, I have generated a pair of split-GFP construct to examine one of the split-site. You can find more details of these experiments on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1473859#.W9er4pNKh3g">zenodo</a>. Going forward, I will be transfecting these constructs into HEK293 cells to examine the following questions: Do these split-protein fragments reconstitute into full-length SCN1A. If so, do they localize and function similar to wild-type SCN1A? Does overproduction of split-protein fragments cause a dominant negative effect on wild-type SCN1A?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Open Sciences World! In my very first post for the SGC’s Extreme Open Sciences project, I will start by providing an overview of my project – Gene therapy for Dravet Syndrome.</p>
<p>Dravet Syndrome is a catastrophic, rare form of infantile epilepsy. The disease onset occurs in the first year of life where children with Dravet Syndrome suffer from frequent and prolonged seizures, cognitive and motor dysfunction and a substantially elevated risk of coma and death. There is currently no cure for Dravet Syndrome. The current standard of care involves using anti-epileptic drugs to relieve its symptoms, but, unfortunately, most anti-epileptic drugs are not very effective.</p>
<p>The majority (&gt;90%) of Dravet Syndrome is caused by mutations in SCN1A gene. This gene encodes a complex pore-forming protein that forms voltage-gated sodium channels on the surface of our neurons. The primary function of these channels is to initiate and transmit electrochemical communicative signals in neurons. They open in response to changes in electrical membrane potential across cell membranes and enable the influx of sodium ions into our neurons. Similar to the electrical currents that power our batteries, you can think of the inflow of ions as electrochemical signals that powers our neural circuit.</p>
<p>Most Dravet Syndrome related mutations result in haploinsufficiency of SCN1A where one copy of SCN1A does not function and having one healthy functioning copy of SCN1A gene is not enough for normal cellular function. One way to treating loss of function or haploinsufficiency disorders is via gene therapy where we make use of a vector, an engineered virus, to deliver back-up functional copies of genes into affected cells to increase the production and to restore functions of the missing proteins. While gene therapy methods have been approved to treat retinal dystrophy and several other diseases, the development of gene therapy for Dravet Syndrome remains a challenge. The engineered virus that we use as a vehicle to deliver gene can only fit ~4.7kb of DNA and SCN1A (~6kb) is too big for this vehicle.</p>
<p>My research focuses on developing a split-intein protein “gluing” system where the SCN1A gene can be split into two smaller fragments that are sufficiently small to be packaged into common gene therapy vehicles. Upon delivery in cells, two fragments of SCN1A protein, each fused to a split-intein, will be expressed. Inteins are protein sequences that can catalyze self-excision and concurrently glue its flanking protein fragments back together. When two fragments of SCN1A proteins fused to split-intein are next to each other, the split-intein can glue two parts of the proteins together, thereby reconstituting functional SCN1A proteins in targeted cells.</p>
