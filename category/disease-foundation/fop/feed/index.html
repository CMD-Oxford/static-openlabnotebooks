										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to test a set of my ALK2 GS loop phosphomutants for activity. As I’ve written about previously, I needed to optimise the concentrations of receptors and decided that 60uM was the right concentration to use as showing activity with the mutants and also being workable in the assay.</p>
<p>I set up three different ALK2 mutants alongside the wild type ALK2 to compare them and used ACVR2 as my necessary type II receptor for SMAD1 activation.</p>
<p>I took time points at 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 45 min, 1h, 1h15, 1h30, 1h45, 2h. Taking 1ul of sample and mixing it with 60ul of mass spec buffer (water + 0.1% formic acid)</p>
<p>I ran these on the mass spec to check for and monitor activity on all components but regrettably ended up seeing zero activity on SMAD1 even after 2h in the wildtype positive control. I did see phosphorylation on the type one receptors but nothing on the SMAD1 which suggested to me that something had gone horribly wrong with the type II receptor and led to it being unable to facilitate SMAD1 activation (as has been previously established to be necessary).</p>
<p>This was, to put it mildly, very frustrating.</p>
<p>So I went and purified a fresh stock of ACVR2 and did a small scale test using just the wild type to see if the positive control worked. This time it did so I set up a larger scale experiment using all the constructs we’ve managed to purify so far (which is all of those created so far except c107, c111 and c112).</p>
<p>This time we saw phosphorylation on SMAD and after 2h we could see strong signal and still make out the differences between the activity of the constructs and so further analysis was done on the 2h time point.</p>
<p>Differences between the different mutants stood out instantly – none of them increased the activity compared to the wild type but there were distinct effects on both the SMAD1 and ALK2 auto-phosphorylation patterns.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MS_Traces.png" alt="" width="1478" height="1149" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3946" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MS_Traces.png 1478w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MS_Traces-300x233.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MS_Traces-768x597.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MS_Traces-1024x796.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1478px) 100vw, 1478px" /></p>
<p><em>Summary figures showing the phosphorylation of SMAD1 and ALK2 using various ALK2 GS loop mutants. The top row on both columns shows the wild type positive control for comparison. The constructs are then ranked from least to most effected moving down the first column (with matching SMAD1 and ALK2 traces) and then down the second column.</em></p>
<p>The last four were the most extreme in terms of knocking out SMAD phosphorylation with the fourth leading to very low levels of phosphorylation and last three basically completely stopping it. When we look at the mutations these four constructs contain we can see a theme in common.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/top_4_hits.png" alt="" width="436" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3947" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/top_4_hits.png 436w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/top_4_hits-300x41.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure showing the mutations contained within the four most detrimental mutations.</em></p>
<p>The three most detrimental constructs (c109, c106 and c113) all contained a S190A mutation with the fourth (c105) containing a T189A mutation just prior to the S190 residue. This suggests that S190 has a key role in facilitating SMAD1 phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Next thing to test is the constructs I’m missing (they need expressing and purifying) and to repeat this experiment before also running the results on a western blot for confirmation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I’m still ‘trying to catch them all’ as the young folks say (!) and building up my collection of purified GS loop mutations so that I can test them all together and start building up a picture of what phosphorylation sites are necessary for SMAD1 activation and which are not.</p>
<p>This time around I was aided ably by Jong Fu who was trying his hand at protein purification for the first time. I think (at least I hope!) you’ll agree he did a pretty good job!</p>
<p>The two mutants we were purifying this time were c108 and c133 which contain one and three mutations respectively. We were also purifying a fresh set of ACVR2A as the last test I did showed no SMAD1 activity (I’m going to write about this in the next blog post along with the follow-up experiment I did with this purification of ACVR2) but did show ACVR1 autophosphorylation suggesting the type I was active but something had happened to the type II protein to inactivate it.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png" alt="" width="780" height="324" class="alignnone wp-image-3300 size-large" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-300x124.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-768x318.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations.png 1165w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Fig. 1 – Showing the phospho-mutations introduced into the GS domain of ALK2</em>.</p>
<p>This time around we also tried a slightly different method of purification using Talon resin bound to cobalt ions rather than using nickle – partly this was because our nickle resin was in a sorry state after many regenerations and partly this was because we’d got access to some cobalt talon resin from the membrane protein group who, because they require super clean resin for each purification, only use it once and then pass it onto other groups for use with higher expressing proteins.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-1024x584.png" alt="" width="780" height="445" class="alignnone wp-image-3775 size-large" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-1024x584.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-300x171.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-768x438.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification.png 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Fig. 2. SDS-PAGE gel of Talon column purification for all constructs showing flowthrough, washes and elutions. Boxed fractions have Tev added and taken on to gel filtration purification.</em></p>
<p>As you can see the talon resin worked out really well and we ended up with a really decent purification from it. The boxed fractions we cleaved overnight with Tev protease to remove the His tag and then concentrated them down to &lt;5ml to purify on a GF75 size exclusion column.</p>
<p>This is shown in the gel below – in this case the boxed fractions are the ones chosen to be taken on for use in experiments – the other fractions, even though they contain the protein of interest, weren’t part of the main gel filtration peak and thus probably represent aggregates of the protein that we don’t want.</p>
<p>We then concentrated down the samples and froze them ready for future assays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been working recently on purifying some proteins for use in future experiments and wanted to explain a little bit about what I need each construct for as they’re all for different things. Purification, as always, is a time consuming business but vital for any biophysical experiment that I do given all my work is in vitro rather than in a cellular context. It’s important to know what you’re putting in any given experiment so that you can interpret the results accurately!</p>
<p>The three proteins I was purifying were:</p>
<p><strong>ALK2</strong> – a short version of the construct containing the Kinase domain only, no GS loop, and a Q207D mutation that makes it consituativly active. We use this construct regularly for co-crystallisation studies and in this case I need some of it for growing some crystals for some mini-fragment screening later on.</p>
<p><strong>ALK2 GS loop mutant</strong> – as described previously, we’ve mutated out various different phosphorylation sites in different combinations within the GS loop of ALK2 to see how this effects the activity. Overall we have 12 different version of this protein, this is one of them. I want to purify several so that I can compare them directly in an experiment all at once.</p>
<p><strong>SUFU</strong> – so this is a slightly different project harking back to some stuff I did a few years ago so bear with me. In the BMP signalling pathway there is a protein called Endofin (ZFYVE16) which is involved in endosomal signalling/trafficking and may have some role in membrane localisation of the receptors and/or their substrates. In the TGFβ pathway the equivalent protein is called SARA and I managed to crystallise a previously unknown domain (a DUF domain or ‘domain of unknown function’) which is in the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4BKW">pdb as 4BKW</a>. This domain had three sub-folds, two of which were known and one of which was novel. The two familiar folds looked a lot like SUFU which is part of the Hedgehog signalling pathway although there is practically no sequence similarity. It is known that Endofin and SARA bind to the protein TOM1 which is also thought to be involved in trafficking. To confirm whether there is a structural or sequence basis to the binding, one test would be to see if TOM1 also associates with SUFU – given the sequence differences between SUFU and SARA it is highly unlikely that TOM1 will bind but it’s worth testing just in case. I obtained a plasmid for an E.coli expressible version of SUFU from <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/christian-siebold">Christian Seibold</a> and a large scale culture was grown up by Charlotte Manning, our new lab assistant.</p>
<p>I’m happy to say that all constructs expressed well and are now safely frozen at -80°C (GS loop AKL2 mutant and SUFU) or used to set up in crystal plates for mini-fragment screening which I’ll do a separate post about soon.</p>
<p>I’ve also manged to grow up a large scale culture of TOM1 (6L of cells) which I’ll set about purifying probably next week so I can then test whether it binds to SUFU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find all the experimental details<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3507756"> over on Zenodo.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello folks, another day another deposition. That makes it sound horribly commonplace but actually Ros put in immense effort into crystallising and solving these proteins and it’s my job just to add the final polish (fix those last stubborn geometry errors), give it a once over to make sure there’s nothing obviously wrong, and whip it into shape to put into the PDB.</p>
<p>This one is another of the M4K structures, this time with M4K2009 which is one of our most promising candidates as shown by Jong Fu and colleagues and is one of the ones being taken forward into more tests. There were two molecules of ALK2 in the asymmetric unit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-1024x587.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="447" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3645" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-300x172.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-768x440.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1.jpg 1183w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>A: Overall structure of ALK2 bound to M4K2009. B: Details of the molecule M4K2009. C: Closeup of the binding pocket showing water mediated H bonds between molecule and side-chains and directly between M4K2009 and the protein hinge region.</p>
<p>The structure is what we expect in a sense, the overall structure of the kinase domain is very similar to usual. Of most interest is the position of water molecules in the binding pocket that help mediate contacts between the protein and the ligand – these help improve the stability and the fit of the compound in the binding site</p>
<p>One other thing of note was the presence of two additional ligand molecules bound to the top of one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit. It is unlikely that these are physiologically relevant and are most likely there as a crystallographic artefact as they are making good contact with chains from the neighbouring unit cell in the crystal.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/odd_ligands-292x300.png" alt="" width="292" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3644" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/odd_ligands-292x300.png 292w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/odd_ligands.png 736w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></p>
<p>Structure of one copy of ALK2 in the asymmetric unit showing two additional M4K2009 compounds bound non-physiologically at the crystallographic interface.</p>
<p>I used the standard wwPDB One Dep system and this structure has been assigned the code: 6SZM and should be released into the wild (that is, once it has been curated by the people at the pdb) asap!</p>

Although currently this project has moved beyond the structure stage, there are still quite a lot of structures that need the final step of tidying up and then depositing into the PDB.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks among the other things I’ve needed to do, I’ve also managed to deposit the first of these structure – ALK2 bound to M4K2117.</p>
<p>This compound showed good potency as has been tested by Jong Fu and is one of the more promising compounds (of which there are around 5) with regards to both potency and selectivity for taking forward to the next stage of the process for more in-depth and extensive testing in both cell and animal models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been getting my stocks in order recently and catching up on some other work which has been both busy but not the most thrilling in terms of experimental results. As such I’ve not had much time to write up a blog post so I’ll try and get back on top of that although it’s not likely to be that world shattering.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to purify versions of ALK2 where various phosphorylation sites at the top of the molecule have been mutated out so that we can see what influence each of the phospho-sites has on the overall activity of ALK2 and hopefully from that work out which sites are essential for ALK2’s function and which are merely ‘nice to haves’ or even not necessary at all. This will hopefully then combine with our study of the mutant version of ALK2 to try and see whether the mutation that causes FOP is interfering with this phosphorylation activation. Anyway – that’s the ultimate goal, in the mean time I’ve been slowly purifying more constructs so that I can do a big experiment comparing all the different constructs at the same time. The main reason I want to do them all at once is to try and minimise the variability that can occur between experimental runs despite best efforts to make everything identical. If I’m actually using the same stock of partner proteins and ATP and metal ions and incubating them for exactly the same time it makes the comparisons between the mutants easier and less likely to contain artefact errors.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: The different ACVR1 (ALK2) GS loop phosphomutants generated and their associated construct id&#8217;s. The top row shows the sequence of the wild type protein. Mutations are shown in red.</em></p>
<p>So – with that I’ve been stockpiling the various mutants as they come through the expression pipeline at the SGC. This time around I’ve been purifying three more constructs – ACVR1-105, 106 and 109 (constructs 107 and 108 and beyond are still to be sorted). <em>(Just a quick reminder that ALK2 and ACVR1 are different ways of referring to the same thing, technically ALK2 is the protein and ACVR1 is the gene)</em></p>
<p>I had a bit of a problem with some of them – I’m not sure why but they seem to require more Nickle resin than usual to purify compared to the wild type construct – I’m not sure if that’s because the mutation makes it harder for the tag to contact the resin or if it is because there is more background contamination than usual in this particular line of cells or whether it’s something else. Luckily they can be rescued through re-incubating the sample with more nickle to pull out the protein and continuing on as usual. This is, while annoying, not a complete loss so while I’m keen to find out why it’s behaving differently it’s not ruined my purification prep.</p>
<p>There are still a couple of constructs left to purify before I run the big experiment and there are a few other small optimisations I need to do as well but I’m getting closer to really getting to the bottom of this question.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the exact purification process then please have a look over on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3453086">Zenodo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;and analysing their activity!</p>
<p>Following on from the work I talked about <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/phosphorylation-over-time-and-phosphomapping-experiments-to-investigate-the-influence-of-alk2-mutations-on-activity/">here</a> I’ve been able to start looking at the influence the different phosphorylation sites have over the ability of ALK2 to activate SMAD1.</p>
<p>Just coming through the SGC expression pipeline are several constructs containing mutations in various combinations of the sites known to be phosphorylated in and around the ‘GS loop’ of ALK2. This will prevent phosphorylation on that site and the change that makes to the activity of ALK2 will tell us something about how that site influences ALK2 function. These are shown in the figure below. Here they’re all labelled as ACVR1 due to our internal system using the gene name rather than the protein name.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png" alt="" width="780" height="324" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3300" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-300x124.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-768x318.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations.png 1165w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>A list of ALK2 constructs containing mutations in the GS loop region of the protein. The mutations are from either Ser or Thr to Ala to knock out phosphorylation on that site.</em></p>
<p>One of the key findings from my previous experiments was that there seemed to be some sites that needed to be phosphorylated for maximal activation of SMAD – for example when a kinase dead type II binding partner was used some sites were not phosphorylated on ALK2 and this also corresponded to a reduction in SMAD1 phosphorylation. These mutants should help me explore which sites are vital for ALK2 activity and ultimately help me understand why the FOP mutation causes increased activity.</p>
<p>Anyway… now that these have been cloned into a baculo expression vector I can start actually purifying the protein and doing some experiments with them.</p>
<p>I had 1l of c103 cells and c104 cells which I purified with fairly high yields. I also had 1l of c105 cells but something went really wrong with the purification and I ended up not having enough to do any actual experiments with. I arranged to get some more c105 cells and 1l c106 cells but while those were being grown I went ahead and did a small scale experiment looking at how c103 and c104 behaved in comparison to the wild type ALK2.</p>
<p>I used my standard assay for monitoring SMAD1 phosphorylation. I incubated SMAD1 with ALK2 and with a type II receptor (in this case ACVR2 and BMPR2) at high enough concentrations to allow receptor association under normal circumstances. I then added activating quantities of ATP along with DTT, Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions necessary for activity and took 1ul samples at regular time intervals up to 30 minutes. The samples were quenched in MS buffer (which contains enough acid to stop any phosphorylation by a kinase) and at the end the results were run on the mass spec machine. Full details of the experimental protocol and the purification can be found over on Zenodo.</p>
<p>The results were fairly interesting but without other experiments remain somewhat inconclusive.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-1024x274.png" alt="" width="780" height="209" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3301" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-1024x274.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-300x80.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-768x205.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Graphs showing the mass peaks detected by mass spec for SMAD1 in its unphosphorylated state and in various states of phosphorylation at +80 Da intervals at both 0 min and 25min for ALK2 wild type, ALK2 c103 and ALK2 c104 mutants.</em></p>
<p>What I can see is that compared to wildtype ALK2, it looks like there is much reduced phosphorylation on SMAD1 using the phosphomutants over 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I also looked at the phosphorylation of ALK2 in this experiment which can be seen in the figure below. This shows that there is a reduction of one occupied phosphorylation site compared to WT which is to be expected given one site has been removed by mutation however given we know from other experiments that there are up to 8 possible phosphorylation sites it’s not clear if the mutation is influencing which of these sites then is occupied.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-1024x265.png" alt="" width="780" height="202" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3299" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-1024x265.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-300x78.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-768x199.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P.png 1984w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p>There are questions unanswered however, such as do the mutations reduce the affinity between the type I and type II proteins such that a higher concentration might be needed to induce association (given that we already need to artificially induce their association via high concentrations to make up for the lack of membrane co-localisation that would occur in the cell) and if left for longer, would they show some activity rather than practically nothing? This suggests my next line of experimental inquiry which will be to alter the concentration of proteins in my experimental setup to see if increasing the concentrations of ALK2 and ACVR2 make any difference to the results in comparison to a wild type control. I’ll also let the experiment run for longer to see if this gives any indication as to whether the activity has been stopped or merely reduced. Increasing the time will also help pick up any differences in ALK2 phosphorylation as it may allow more sites to become occupied and thus pick up any limitations that the mutation is putting on that aside from the removal of one site by the mutation its self.</p>
<p>I’ll also think about looking at SMAD1 phosphorylation by western blot in addition to mass spec as we have a good antibody for looking at specifically phosphorylated SMAD1 which will show up very small amounts of phosphorylated SMAD1 that the mass spec might miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry I’ve not written for a while. I had some annual leave to use up and then I’ve been helping out with a residential EMBO course that was being co-organised by one of the group leaders in my department. The course was an introduction to a wide variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. I was helping out with a purification comparison between nickel resin, talon (cobalt) resin and streptactin resin and talking a bit about thermal shift assays.</p>
<p>Anyway, on with the science!</p>
<p><strong>TNIK Selectivity:</strong></p>
<p>TNIK is a protein kinase that Ros has previously talked about as being a potential off target hit for many of the M4K compounds along with DDR1. It is highly expressed in the brain which makes it of relevance to drug discovery for DIPG. Although its function is not entirely clear we know over-expression leads to cell rounding and it has been linked to some cell signalling effects in certain cancers. What makes it of most interest to us is that it seems to phosphorylate SMAD1 in an inhibitory position away from the tail where ALK2 phosphorylates SMAD1. Theoretically phosphorylation of SMAD1 by TNIK should inhibit phosphorylation elsewhere on SMAD1 by ALK2. This might make TNIK an indirect inhibitor of ALK2 function and thus we don’t want any drug we design against ALK2 to also hit TNIK.</p>
<p>I was working with a student, Mira Rothweiler, who purified TNIK that we then used in further experiments. Details for the purification can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3257646">Zenodo</a> along with other details of the experiments done.</p>
<p>I have used Tm shift analysis (which is where you look at the change in melting point of a protein caused by the binding of a ligand, the tighter it binds the more it stabilises the protein and thus the larger the shift) to look at the binding of TNIK to all the M4K compounds and compared it to the shifts seen in ALK2. I plotted this data against each other with ALK2 shifts along the x-axis and the TNIK shifts along the y-axis. When compared against a 1:1 line, anything below the line is likely to be more selective for ALK2, anything above the line is likely to be selective for TNIK and anything close to the line shows minimal selectivity.</p>
<p>The data shows that while there are a small handful of M4K compounds that do hit TNIK, the vast majority seem to have a relatively low effect on TNIK and a high effect on ALK2 suggesting they are selective. One of the most promising M4K targets (M4K2009) gives a 14.1 °C shift for ALK2 but only 1.8 °C for TNIK. This is really good news.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-816x1024.png" alt="" width="780" height="979" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3017" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-816x1024.png 816w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-239x300.png 239w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-768x964.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK.png 1681w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

</em></p>
<p><strong>TNIK activity:</strong></p>
<p>While it has been reported that TNIK phosphorylates SMAD1 in a non-standard location in vivo, I wanted to see if I could get the same effect in vitro in my own experiments. I mixed SMAD1 with TNIK in different concentrations and for different lengths of time and took samples to run on mass spec to see whether SMAD1 was getting phosphorylated. My results showed that with concentrations of TNIK of 10mM and over after just 10 minutes I was starting to see phosphorylation on SMAD1. However this doesn’t tell me where that phosphorylation is happening.</p>
<p>I used another mass spec technique called ‘phosphomapping’ to identify where the phosphate was being added. Dr. Rod Chalk helped me with this for which I’m very thankful. This technique involved chopping the protein up into known chunks using different proteases that cut the protein at specific predictable places. We used five different proteases on different samples from the same incubation that all cut in different locations and then with each of the samples we ran half of it on the mass spec as was, and with the other half passed it over a Ti/Zr column to enrich the phosphopeptides within it and then ran it on the mass spec. The peptides detected are then run against a database of expected peptides created from knowing both the sequence of the protein and where the protease would have cut and then allowing for the possibility of modifications such as phosphorylation.</p>
<p>From this we detected a number of different phosphorylation sites on both SMAD1 and TNIK which are summarised in the diagram below.</p>

<p><em>Summary of identified peptides showing overall coverage (red), definitive phosphorylation (blue) and ambiguous phosphorylation (orange). Consensus site for TNIK phosphorylation of SMAD1 from Wang et. al. 2016 shown boxed in blue.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of sites were identified on TNIK which must be due to auto-phosphorylation. Three sites were identified on SMAD1 definitively and a further three ambiguously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three of these sites (one firm and two ambiguous &#8211; PI<strong>SS</strong>V<strong>S</strong>) are known sites of phosphorylation by ALK2 however we know that ALK2 cannot phosphorylate them alone and requires a type II receptor for this to happen – it seems that under in-vitro conditions TNIK is not under the same restriction.</li>
<li>One of these sites (FE<strong>T</strong>VY) is not known to be involved in SMAD1 inhibition but it cannot be ruled out yet and may bear further investigation</li>
<li>Two of these sites (one firm and one ambiguous – RN<strong>ST</strong>IE) are in the location suggested by Wang et. al. (2016) as being the consensus sequence for TNIK phosphorylation of SMAD1.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next thing to check will be if SMAD phosphorylated in the ‘inhibitory’ position stops ALK2 from phosphorylating SMAD in the ‘normal’ position.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing with our goal to synthesize three compounds as ALK2 inhibitors, let’s refer back to Scheme 2 in the previous post on this topic, compounds <strong>6</strong>, <strong>8</strong> and <strong>9</strong> were synthesized in good yields (65-90%), however compound <strong>10</strong> could not be obtained.</p>
<div id="attachment_2597" style="width: 748px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2597" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM.png" alt="" width="738" height="522" class=" wp-image-2597" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM.png 918w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM-300x212.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM-768x544.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2597" class="wp-caption-text">Scheme 2. Synthesis route 1</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Different conditions were tested to induce the cyclization of the bromo-pyrazine-2-carboxamide <strong>9</strong> to the target bromo-pyrazin-2-amine <strong>10</strong>. This reaction mostly yielded starting material <strong>9 </strong>and by-product <strong>11</strong> in low yields (&lt;15%). After several attempts, this approach (acid/heat) was abandoned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2926" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2926" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-4.17.14-PM.png" alt="" width="736" height="592" class=" wp-image-2926" /><p id="caption-attachment-2926" class="wp-caption-text">Scheme 3. Synthesis route 2</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative synthetic route is shown in Scheme 3.  Here, aminopirazine <strong>12</strong> will be reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) to yield carbaldehyde <strong>13</strong>, which then will be reacted with diamine <strong>6</strong> (previously synthesized) at 200 <sup>o</sup>C using dimethylacetamide (DMA) as a solvent. This last step can be carried out in a microwave reactor and should yield the cyclized compound pyridinpyrazin-2-amine <strong>14</strong>, which can be brominated with <em>N</em>-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) to yield compound <strong>10</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it was mentioned before, <strong>10 </strong>could not be synthesized by the previously proposed route. The new route is adapted from international patent WO 2008/071937 and we hope in this way we can access to this key intermediate in 150-200 mg scale to move forward with more reactions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the crystals from my last post I sent them along on the last Diamond trip we had to <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I04">beamline I04</a> but regrettably didn’t get any usable datasets. Perhaps fortunately there is a possible explanation for this that isn’t just ‘the crystals were a bit too rubbish’. We send our crystals to the Diamond Light Source and because of the high number of crystals sent on each trip by the department (124 on the last trip) not everyone goes along on every trip and we quite often use something called ‘auto-centering’ that uses a computer algorithm to find the edge of the loop and to align the loop and your crystal in the beam. Centering is necessary but also quite tricky, because to collect a data set you need ‘slices’ of data taken with the crystal at different angles so the loop the crystals are mounted in, is rotated by a robotic arm so that the crystal also rotates around inside the x-ray beam. Thus if your crystal isn’t aligned properly, as the loop rotates it moves you crystal out of the beam and thus you get no data at that point.</p>
<p>Usually the automatic alignment is really good, however this time around it didn’t work so well and quite often either my crystal wasn’t in the beam at all (it mistook the loop stem for the crystal) or it started in the beam and then rotated out of it (which is what I think happened in the case shown below where you can see two ‘periods’ of data with dips in between. This is, of course, suboptimal and leads to a data set that you can’t really use.</p>
<p>I’m resending the crystals to the beamline this Friday and hopefully going with them myself. The silver lining to this is that I know that some of them definitely diffract which is encouraging. Hopefully they’ll behave well when fully in the beam.</p>
