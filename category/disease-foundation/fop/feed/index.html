				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the crystals from my last post I sent them along on the last Diamond trip we had to <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I04">beamline I04</a> but regrettably didn’t get any usable datasets. Perhaps fortunately there is a possible explanation for this that isn’t just ‘the crystals were a bit too rubbish’. We send our crystals to the Diamond Light Source and because of the high number of crystals sent on each trip by the department (124 on the last trip) not everyone goes along on every trip and we quite often use something called ‘auto-centering’ that uses a computer algorithm to find the edge of the loop and to align the loop and your crystal in the beam. Centering is necessary but also quite tricky, because to collect a data set you need ‘slices’ of data taken with the crystal at different angles so the loop the crystals are mounted in, is rotated by a robotic arm so that the crystal also rotates around inside the x-ray beam. Thus if your crystal isn’t aligned properly, as the loop rotates it moves you crystal out of the beam and thus you get no data at that point.</p>
<p>Usually the automatic alignment is really good, however this time around it didn’t work so well and quite often either my crystal wasn’t in the beam at all (it mistook the loop stem for the crystal) or it started in the beam and then rotated out of it (which is what I think happened in the case shown below where you can see two ‘periods’ of data with dips in between. This is, of course, suboptimal and leads to a data set that you can’t really use.</p>
<p>I’m resending the crystals to the beamline this Friday and hopefully going with them myself. The silver lining to this is that I know that some of them definitely diffract which is encouraging. Hopefully they’ll behave well when fully in the beam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been lucky enough to have a student (Mira) in the lab working with me for the past few weeks and so I’d like to write about the work that we’ve been doing together.</p>
<p>We spent some time cleaning up an old sample of ALK2 that Ros had left over in the freezer to set up in crystal plates with some compounds from M4K Pharma that they were relatively keen to see the structures of.</p>
<p>We used a specialised coarse screen that Ros had designed containing only conditions where we had previously seen crystals in the wider coarse screens. This means that we can narrow down the field where we’re expecting to find crystals and test fewer conditions to find the one we need – this means setting up fewer plates and thus needing less protein per compound tested, so is overall more efficient.</p>
<p>We set up the plates (at 4C and 20C) at around 9mg/ml with compounds M4K2163, M4K2143, M4K2192, M4K2207 and M4K2194 at 1mM concentration from 25mM stocks.</p>
<p>We found some interesting crystals, one of which was mountable as is (from M4K2192) and several across all the compounds, which showed small crystals that would be worth following up in more specific conditions.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2754" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M4K2192.png" alt="" width="403" height="294" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M4K2192.png 403w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M4K2192-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p><em>Crystals of ALK2/ACVR1A with compound M4K2192</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Mira designed some follow up screens based on the conditions that showed small crystals and we set up some more plates with those conditions in the hope of turning those small crystals into larger, better crystals. We had enough protein to set up followup plates for compounds M4K2163 and M4K2143 at 9.5mg/ml. From these plates we mounted 5 crystals across the board and combined with those above ended up with crystals of unknown quality across three compounds. These have been confirmed as containing protein by imaging the drops by UV light (UV light interacts with protein to make crystals only visible under UV light if they contain protein rather than just being salt) and are now waiting to be sent to the synchrotron to see if they actually diffract or not.  You can read more about the technical details <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2650203#.XMB29jBKiUk">here on Zenodo.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve got a few things to catch up with on the blog – one of them is to talk about a conference I attended in Oxford recently. I attended the <a href="https://www.biochemistry.org/Events/tabid/379/MeetingNo/SA217/view/Conference/Default.aspx">Biochemical Society BMP Signalling in Cancer II</a> meeting which was held in St. Annes College, Oxford. At this meeting I presented a poster on the work I’ve been doing (and which has been written about here as it’s happened) on looking at how the mutations in ALK2 effect the underlying activity of the kinase as well as effecting how well FKBP12 can inhibit ALK2.</p>
<p>The conference brought together 60 researchers in the field from around the world talking about a variety of different cancers but also other BMP related conditions such as FOP. Over three days there were some fantastic talks by the leaders in the field including from Dr. Caroline Hill from the Crick Institute in London who spoke about receptor cross talk in BMP signalling and how that might affect signalling through ALK2 and Prof. Eileen Shore from the university of Pennsylvania who spoke about mechanosensing and tissue stiffness in FOP.</p>
<p>I had a chance to get into some really interesting conversations with some of the attendees about the way their work and my work intersected and how we might be able to collaborate in the future – particularly interesting was talking to some Postdocs from Caroline Hill’s group who are looking at similar problems to me but from an in-cell perspective rather than using purified proteins. From that some interesting questions have been thrown up that I now want to test in my in-vitro systems and that will be detailed here as and when I’ve had a chance to try them. Hopefully this can lead to validation of both my work and theirs by complementing in-vivo and in-vitro approaches.</p>
<p>I thought it would be good to share the poster I created here – so you can find it <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2640488#.XLRgljBKiUk">over on Zenodo</a>. It is designed for a scientific audience but not necessarily an FOP specialist audience so hopefully it should be fairly easy to follow. It leads the reader through the story of explaining that Gain of Function (GOF) mutations in ALK2 are involved in diseases like FOP and DIPG. I then go on to present data that shows that these mutations disrupt the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12 but that this isn’t the whole story (as regular readers of this blog will know). Then I talk about what I found out about what is needed for SMAD activation by ALK2 before looking at the increased phosphorylation of SMAD1 by the mutant ALK2 proteins compared to the wild type. This covers both the western blot data that shows more SMAD1 activation but also the mass spec data I’ve shared previously that looks at more SMAD1 and more ALK2 phosphorylation. Finally I showed the phosphomapping data on ALK2 that is starting to pick apart the exact phosphorylation locations on ALK2 that are necessary for SMAD1 activation (Also data I’ve talked about on this blog before). In this case it was nice to see that all the effort Rod and I had put into phosphomapping had paid off! Other groups had said they’d tried and been unable to map ALK2 using trypsin alone but our method of using 5 different enzymes both enriched and unenriched seems to have done the trick (despite it being 10x more work!).</p>
<p>There is great value from attending a conference like this and in this case I feel that I really did make some very important connections and had some very informative discussions that were directly relevant to my research and that will hopefully bear fruit in time and guide the direction of my experiments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post I’d like to return to looking at my work on phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is a key signalling method for activating the BMP pathway and inducing activity. Specifically activation of ALK2 by phosphorylation leads to phosphorylation of SMAD1 which leads to gene transcription that ultimately is responsible for bone formation.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to talk about two experiments – the first is looking at the rate of phosphorylation (or how active) of two ALK2 mutants, L196P and R258S. The second is to look at mapping the exact sites of phosphorylation on two of the more common ALK2 mutations in FOP, R206H and Q027E.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phosphorylation over time in ALK2 L196P and R258S.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve talked <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/phosphorylation-of-smad1-rates-as-a-function-of-alk2-mutations-and-type-ii-association/">previously</a> about how phosphorylation is effected by the Q207E and R206H mutations in ALK2. This time I wanted to look at some additional mutants that are found in a small proportion of cases of FOP, specifically L196P, R258S, G328E and R375P. I purified the long forms of these ALK2 mutations in a standard fashion. Regrettably only L196P and R258S gave a good yield of expressed protein while the other two constructs gave me no expression of protein. I set up my standard activation assay with these ALK2 mutants (I mixed them with SMAD1 and with either ACVR2 or BMPR2, before adding ATP, DTT and Mg2+/Mn2+ in order to start the reaction), taking samples over time periodically up to 30 minutes. The samples were then analysed by mass spec to look for intact mass shifts corresponding to phosphorylation.</p>
<p>I plotted the peaks corresponding to phosphorylated states of both ALK2 and SMAD1 at the different time points and used this 3D graph to compare different mutant’s behaviour with respect to the activity of ALK2. I also compared this data to previously obtained data from the previous blog post.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2580" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-806x1024.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="991" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-236x300.jpg 236w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MS_timecourse_blogpost-768x975.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Time course plots for phosphorylation of SMAD1 (top) and ALK2 L196P or R258S (bottom) in the presence of ACVR2 (left) or BMPR2 (right). Legend shows time point in seconds.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall we can see that R258S appears to be more activating than L196P with both more SMAD activation over the first five minutes (including the appearance of a potentially interesting third SMAD binding site). This is the case when using either ACVR2 or BMPR2. Also in general ACVR2 appears to lead to more SMAD activation than BMPR2 regardless of mutation.</p>
<p>When looking at ALK2 phosphorylation, we can see that L196P is quickly phosphorylated up to three times compared to R258S but that over the course of five minutes, R258S accumulates up to 6 phosphorylation’s much more rapidly than L196P. This effect is most pronounced when paired with ACVR2.</p>
<p>What this means in very broad terms is that the different ALK2 FOP mutants are differently activating and that their response to different type II receptors change depending on which mutation is present. This is similar to the results seen with other ALK2 mutants studied previously. This builds towards understanding why the ALK2 FOP mutations leads to increased signalling and thus increased bone formation and exactly what is going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phosphomapping of ALK2 R206H and Q207E:</strong></p>
<p>Another aspect of looking at the phosphorylation of ALK2 and SMAD1 is not just how much it is phosphorylated but also where it is phosphorylated. For this I worked with Rod Chalk in our mass spec department to map the phosphorylation sites present in samples of protein incubated as previously mentioned. In this case I was looking at Q207E and R206H mutants of ALK2 paired with either ACVR2 or BMPR2, all in the presence of SMAD. This suggested that many of the phosphorylations could be traced to the following positions in the GS region of the kinase regardless of ALK2 mutation:</p>
<p><strong><u>ST</u></strong>LADLLDH<strong><u>S</u></strong>C<strong><u>TS</u></strong>G<strong><u>S</u></strong>G<strong><u>S</u></strong>GLPFLVQRTV</p>
<p>However not all these sites are seen at the same time and it is hard to determine which are essential for transmission of signal and ALK2 activation.</p>
<p>Similarly phosphorylation on SMAD1 could be traced to the following common locations at the C-terminal tail of the protein:</p>
<p>TQMGSPHNPI<strong><u>SS</u></strong>V<strong><u>S</u></strong></p>
<p>In this case it is the last three serines in the tail that are able to be phosphorylated and again, are seen with both mutations. Combinations of the three possible sites and all three at once were seen as possibilities within the phosphomapping data.</p>
<p>What this means however is a bit less clear. When considering the time course data from the previous post linked as well as the new mutant time course data and the phosphomapping it seems to suggest that you require multiple (up to 6) ALK2 phosphorylations to get maximal (3 site) SMAD1 phosphorylation and that there are at least this many sites in the GS loop and the region just prior to it.</p>
<p>In order to properly probe the necessity of each of these sites, it is going to be necessary to repeat these mass spec experiments on knock out mutants that remove the phosphorylation sites in various combinations, to really see which are essential for ALK2 activation. These are currently being cloned so hopefully I’ll be able to test them soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know as many as 30% of the cells in labs could be misidentified? And what a nightmare it would be to find out years of your work are just completely wrong because you got your skin cells mixed up with your brain cells&#8230;</p>
<p>So to avoid that catastrophe, I took some time to check the DNA sequence of the ACVR1 gene, because for this gene we know what should be mutated (or not) for each of my cell lines. This way I can make sure that I haven&#8217;t mixed them up in the past year (<em>and</em> that they haven&#8217;t picked up new mutations in this important area all by themselves).</p>
<p>All I had to do was collect the genomes of the cells, amplify specifically the ACVR1 gene, send it for overnight sequencing, and then I get a trace like this back from the facility:</p>
<div id="attachment_2544" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1.png"><img class="wp-image-2544 size-large" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-1024x396.png" alt="Sequencing trace covering the R206H mutation in ACVR1 found in FOP and DIPG" width="780" height="302" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-1024x396.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-300x116.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/R206H-sequence-1-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sequencing trace covering the R206H mutation in ACVR1 found in FOP and DIPG</p></div>
<p>Each DNA base has one peak, except one that has both a guanine (G) and an adenine (A) DNA base. The adenine, present on one chromosome, causes the change from an arginine (R) to a histidine (H) at the 206th position of the ACVR1 protein i.e. the R206H mutation.</p>
<p>This trace is from the HSJD-DIPG-007 cell line and is the mutation I expected. According to all my sequencing, none of my cell lines have gotten mixed up, yay!</p>
<p>You can read the full details of how I did this, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2579809#.XHgumMD7SUk">here on Zenodo</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ZFYVE9C (Otherwise known as SARA) is a scaffold protein involved in the association of various protein components as part of the TGFB signalling pathway. The equivalent in the BMP signalling pathway is a protein known as Endofin so studying SARA (which is slightly easier) might give us useful insights for both proteins. For more details on this project please see <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/a-summary-of-my-alk2-project-goals/">this blog post.</a></p>
<p>One of the unanswered questions about SARA is what does one of the major domains that it has actually do? (The domain is known as a DUF domain, or a Domain of Unknown Function!) We know the structure but that hasn’t given us any clues as to its function. One thought was that it might be involved in recruiting type I or type II receptors close to their binding partners such as one of the SMADs to allow signal propagation.</p>
<p>I purified the DUF domain of SARA and mixed it with either excess TGFBR1 or excess TGFBR2 (the two relevant receptors in the TGFB pathway). I tested the receptors in both the unphosphorylated (inactive) and phosphorylated (active) states. After incubating the samples for 30 minutes while concentrating the volume back down to &lt;5ml, I ran them down a gel filtration column to see if the two proteins bound together sufficiently to shift the peaks coming off the column which would indicate they were acting as a complex of larger mass.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2516" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-1024x491.png" alt="" width="780" height="374" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-1024x491.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-300x144.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-768x368.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c.png 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Overlay of the UV traces from all the size exclusion gel filtration runs to show the relative elution volumes of the peaks confirming no shift in the ZFYVE9C peak consistent with no complex being formed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn’t see any shift in the peak for SARA suggesting that either the two proteins don’t bind or that the affinity is weak enough that they fall apart under the conditions of the gel filtration column.</p>
<p>The next thing to try will be to purify the proteins again but not to cleave the tag on one of the binding partners (either the receptors or the SARA protein) and try to do a pull down experiment to test whether this shows any association or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve not posted in a while, mainly because things have been really busy, but good busy, as I now have 3 new datasets/structures, of ALK2 with M4K2118, M4K2149 and, amazingly, M4K2009. As you know, this is our lead candidate, which until now has not behaved very well in crystal trials, and it hasn’t been possible to get decent crystals. In my last post I told you how I had somehow managed to mix up the TNIK and ACVR1/ALK2 tubes when I was setting up the plates, and accidentally put ACVR1 into a coarse screen and TNIK into a fine screen for ACVR1. Well, after I got lovely big crystals for what I thought was ACVR1 with M4K3003, I sent them to the synchrotron, got beautiful data to 1.4 Å, phased it, and lo and behold! It was M4K2009 snugly fitted into the binding pocket (see the ligand density after molecular replacement below). Of course, I didn’t notice this was a trimethoxy containing compound (how??) before I excitedly emailed everyone to tell them I had M4K3003, and then had to retract … However, the story ends well as M4K2009 is really important.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2511" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="509" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-768x432.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, I got data for M4K2149 (~2.6 Å), one of the amide head group containing compounds we’re interested to see, and M4K2118 (~1.4 Å), which is doing well in some of the other assays too. I’ve put the .mtz files <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2573142#.XGw9g-j7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo if you want to play with high resolution data, and some images below showing the ligand density and the ligands binding in the pocket. The amide head group of M4K2149 appears to preserve the water network in the pocket that we’ve observed in other structures, but as the resolution is too low for waters, we can’t tell til we get higher resolution data. Which hopefully will be this week, as I’ve grown some really pretty crystals for M4K2149 that I hope will diffract better. These appeared quite by accident again, as I’d designed a fine screen around the D5 well condition of my mega composite screen, but neglected to notice when I validated the screen that I’d put 10 x less ammonium sulphate in one row than intended – should have been 0.9 M, but ended up being 0.09 M. I should probably start calling myself ‘the accidental crystallographer’ at this rate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2509" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve got some small crystals for M4K3007, another structure we really want, and some pretty ones for M4K2184, another amide head group compound. I’ve followed up the M4K3007, just waiting to see if anything appears, and will send the tiny ones to the synchrotron while waiting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2508" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png" alt="" width="849" height="478" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" /></p>
<p>I’m also very happy to say that our new M4K2117 crystal system for XChem fragment screening has worked very nicely so far, in the sense that the crystals are large and relatively robust and can handle soaking in low salt conditions as well as compounds with DMSO for a few hours. They then still diffract to around 1.2-1.8 Å, consistently in the same space group, C 1 2 1. This is a vast improvement over the previous system with LDN-193189. We did a solvent characterisation and pre-screen a couple of weeks ago with 100 crystals, and of the 20 or so hits we got, none was in the allosteric pocket we are looking for. This could be because of the 1.4 M ammonium sulphate and 0.2 M Na/K tartrate I have in there, which might prevent access of fragments to the pocket. Thus, using the remarkable shifter that Nathan Wright at SGC designed, we’ll be transferring loads of crystals from grow plates to low salt soak plates before doing the compound soaks this week, with the same 100 compounds, in order to check if the hit rate/location changes.</p>
<p>I will mention though, for anyone who may never have noticed this, the DMSO concentration in the protein solution for crystallisation is very important! I had previously been using Batch 1 of M4K2117 for my co-crystallisation, but it ran out so I used Batch 2, which was a 50 mM stock, as opposed to the previous 25 mM stock. The plates I set up with this, the same in every other way, gave showers of rather ugly, crunchy, small crystals. So I tried a few things – diluted the stock to 25 mM in DMSO and set up plates with that, with both lower and higher concentrations of protein (8 and 14 mg/ml along with the usual 10-11 mg/ml), as well as using the stock as is, with lower and higher protein concentrations. The lower stock concentrations brought back the big, perfect, beautiful crystals from before, the higher stock, no matter the protein concentration, gave ugly chunks and showers. The final concentration of compound was the same in all, so clearly the DMSO percentage is a very important factor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I’d spend a blog post just talking about the various paths of my research and try and tie it all together. A lot of my experiments do dot around these various arms of investigation and so one experimental post doesn’t necessarily tie in directly with the previous one or the next one and I thought it might be a good idea to explain why and summarise where I’m up to with each strand.</p>
<p>My main focus of research is to investigate the cause of the disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). We know that it’s caused by a mutation in ALK2 which leads to excessive bone formation. This also nicely dovetails with research done into DIPG where 25% of cases share a mutation with FOP in ALK2.</p>
<p>My research can be broken down in to three main strands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is looking at characterising the binding of ligands to ALK2 in order to optimise binding and work towards finding a potent and specific inhibitor. This is the focus of a lot of the M4K work that Jong Fu and Ros are doing and I’ve been doing a little bit of that as well but it’s not the main focus of my work. This endeavour is going fairly well – despite setbacks relating to protein expression (which are not entirely solved – we now have regained expression of the kinase domain alone but we still don’t have expression of the kinase domain and GS loop construct) and Ros has a number of structures that she’s working on at the moment that have been recently collected. Alas I’ve not had as much luck with new structures recently. We frequently get new deliveries of compounds from M4K to test – Jong Fu looks at them in cells while Ros and I try and crystallise the most promising candidates with varying degrees of success. Ros and I have also attempted XChem fragment screening which is where we use high throughput crystallography to identify small weakly bound fragments that might identify new leads for drug design or in our case, help us identify drugs that might bind to a second allosteric site within ALK2 away from the main ligand binding pocket. An XChem update will be coming soon from either Ros or myself as I’ve recently started helping her with this aspect of the work and so have been shadowing her on our last couple of visits to Diamond.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The second is investigating the interactions of the type I receptor (ALK2) with its partnering type II in order to activate SMAD 1/5/8. This covers looking at receptor cross reactivity, SMAD cross reactivity, and the influence of mutations on this. This also involves looking at crystal structures of the mutants where possible, attempting to make complexes of the type I and type II receptors in order to try and crystallise them and probing the activities of the proteins and the various disease mutants. Covered in this is everything I’ve done using western blots and mass spec to identify the dependencies of this complex as required for SMAD phosphorylation. So far I know that the mutants are more active than the wild type (with R206H being the most active ALK2 mutation), that the type II must be present but does not need to be active to allow for SMAD activation and that increased activity is not solely dependent upon the removal of inhibition by FKBP12. Covered in this is also the work looking at mapping the phosphorylation sites in ALK2 to try and identify if some of these sites are more critical than others with relation to SMAD activation. The cloning I recently talked about is part of this investigation, making mutations to remove certain phosphorylation sites and comparing the activity of these with the wild type. As soon as these constructs have been cloned into suitable expression vectors I’ll be starting that experiment too. Another aspect of this is looking at the association of other proteins with the receptors, such as the possible link between them and XIAP as I talked about in one earlier blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The third aspect is looking other proteins related to the ALK2 pathway such as Endofin. Endofin is a membrane associated protein with multiple domains including a SMAD binding domain and large areas of unknown function. It is involved with the co-localisation of various parts of the pathway and appears to act as something of a scaffold protein to hold things in close proximity for signal propagation. The equivalent protein in the TGFβ pathway is called SARA and appears to have a similar function in that pathway. Some time ago I solved the structure for a domain of unknown function within SARA (4BKW) which contained a novel fold and showed structural (but not sequence) similarity to a protein called SUFU, which is part of the Hedgehog signalling pathway. We still don’t know what this protein and domain does or what it binds to or how it functions and so this is another area of investigation. If we can uncover the function of SARA we can also try and uncover the function of Endofin and this might provide a better understanding of the way FOP mutations work and help us see if there are any other ways we can target the pathway that are not exclusively based on inhibiting ALK2 activity. However given that the DUF domain has very little information about it, our investigations into what it does have been limited thus far. My goals with this are to try and probe the role of the DUF domain looking for whether it binds to either of the type I or type II receptors, and if so which parts of the receptors, or if it associates with a different protein all together. Given we know very little about what it does and the structure offers few clues (the lack of sequence similarity to SUFU means that although we can predict a possible binding mode, the nature of what binds there is very hard to determine as there are no conserved residues) this is quite a difficult problem to approach.</li>

<p>My work moves between these three strands depending on how much and which proteins I’ve got available to me &#8211; do I have any in the freezer already purified or do I need to make fresh? And that’s if I have the pellets in the freezer of the expressed protein in the first place. It also varies depending on whether we have new compounds we’re interested in testing immediately from either M4K or other collaborators, or whether I’ve got data I need to analyse from previous successful crystallisation attempts. Sometimes I’ll be looking at my own structural data and sometimes I’ll be looking at someone else’s structure which we call ‘proofreading’ to double check it for errors and make sure nothing has been missed. Sometimes we’ll have time at Diamond and so everything else has to be put on hold in order to make use of that visit (such as XChem trips) and sometimes there’s a lot of data analysis to do on other experiments &#8211; writing it up and understanding what the data is telling us is just as important for progress as the experiments themselves.</p>
<p>Having the three strands means I can move from one to another as each strand has its own peaks and lulls in activity at different times. I’m afraid it does make for a slightly more disjointed blog journey but I hope you’ll bear with me through it all as I try and make sense of the problems I’m investigating.</p>
<p>I’ll try and post again sooner rather than later on what I’ve been doing in January as it has been really rather bitty and frustrating in terms of things actually working but hopefully February will bring with it some more productive experiments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further down the line I want to be able to test the activation of the BMP signalling pathway downstream of the ALK2 receptor. For this I plan to use the alkaline phosphatase gene as a readout &#8211; it&#8217;s a well known gene activated downstream of BMP signalling so a lot of easy to use assays already exist for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/optimising-an-assay-to-detect-alkaline-phosphatase-activity-in-c2c12-cells/">when I tested this assay with the standard C2C12 cell line it didn&#8217;t work particularly well</a> so I&#8217;ve decided to try again with a new set of cells. This time I&#8217;m choosing connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) from FOP patients as a reporter cell line because they respond more strongly to the signals that activate the BMP pathway (called BMP ligands).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never worked with these cells before so, again, I needed to work out how many I&#8217;ll need to get a good result from the assay. These cells however grow as a very thin sheet which is so see-through that I initially couldn&#8217;t tell if the wells were full. To solve this I used stains called Calcein AM and Hoechst. Calcein AM can stain any living cell because they metabolise it from a see-through molecule into a fluorescent green product, whereas Hoechst can stick to DNA and turn all the cell nuclei blue, and so suddenly, all of my cells glow:</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t they pretty?</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re this easy to see, it&#8217;s even easier to see how many cells are needed to fill a well, but not get overcrowded. You can read more about how I did that in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2546911">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The only question I have left is why some cells didn&#8217;t stain with Calcein AM, even though their nucleus looks fine? Anyone know the answer?</p>
