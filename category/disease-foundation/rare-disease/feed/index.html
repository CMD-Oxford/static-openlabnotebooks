				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the Ramsey Lab, this project began in 2018, when we were invited to a parent-organized meeting for caregivers of GRIN1 patients. Our group uses mice to study the NMDA receptor (which is encoded by the GRIN genes) in the context of schizophrenia and autism. It was only in 2018 that we learned of a rare disease caused by de novo mutations in the GRIN1 gene. Then we learned that single base pair mutations have been discovered in all of the seven GRIN genes that encode NMDA receptors. We have since moved our research focus towards helping GRIN patients, and have joined the growing community of scientists and clinicians with this same goal.</p>
<p>What are the features of GRIN disorders? All patients have some level of intellectual disability, but other features of the syndrome are variable, depending on the individual patient and the nature of their specific variant. Many children have low muscle tone that leads to developmental delays in motor skills and difficulties feeding. Many children have seizures that vary in severity from brief and infrequent to life-threatening. Other common symptoms include reduced or absent speech, cortical visual impairment, hyperactive and repetitive movements, and sleep disturbances. In talking with caregivers, it seems clear that these symptoms are the ones where therapeutic interventions could greatly improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>It is an enormous task to care for and raise a child with such special needs. However, the GRIN parents have found each other through online support groups. They are providing helpful information about medicines and about the occupational therapy that enables GRIN patients to gain motor skills. They have also started foundations to help other parents and caregivers, or to provide financial support for research.</p>
<p>The support network that GRIN parents have developed should set the example for GRIN researchers. It is our hope that the cooperation of parents to share information and advance medical care will inspire scientists to build an open science community. If you would like to join the GRIN disorder open science platform to share your research, please email me at a.ramsey@utoronto.ca.</p>

<p>Nature has evolved molecules called glycoproteins that are proteins carrying sugar chains (&#8220;glycans&#8221;). Glycans can make proteins more soluble, they can shield them from the environment, they can be used as calling cards to enable protein-protein recognition; in Eukaryotes, a glucose-on/glucose-off quality control system uses glycans to monitor glycoproteins folding.</p>
<p>In general, glycans contribute to expanding the repertoire of protein shapes and sizes that genomes code for, and sugars on proteins are a great asset to nature. Protein chemists on the other hand are not always happy with the glycans on the proteins they produce. This is especially true of molecular biologists forcing cells to synthesise custom glycoproteins: these &#8216;recombinant glycoproteins&#8217; may end up with glycans that differ from naturally occurring ones.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the ability of stripping sugars from glycoproteins has helped a number of species to survive, and enzymes that can cleave glycans from glycoproteins (&#8220;deglycosylases&#8221;) are encoded in many a genome. By offering such enzymes, nature comes therefore to the succour of molecular biologists and protein chemists who are unhappy with the glycans on the proteins they handle: by treating a glycoprotein with a deglycosylase, it is possible to get rid of the sugars and obtain a sugar-free protein.</p>
<p>In our case, crystals of a glycoprotein we are studying grew a flimsy lattice formed by glycan-glycan contacts, making the resulting glycoprotein structure all fuzzy. We are hoping that one way of improving on these crystals and obtaining a better structure would be to strip the glycoprotein of the glycans altogether, perhaps enabling the growth of different crystals, kept together by more stable, less mobile protein-protein contacts.</p>
<p>For this reason, we decided to treat our glycoprotein with a special deglycosylase called PNGase F. The enzyme belongs to a rare bacterium called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethkingia_miricola"><em>Elizabethkingia miricola</em>, </a>first isolated from condensation water in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir">Space Station Mir</a>. But a small vial of the enzyme can cost up to £1000 when purchased from commercial sources! We therefore endeavoured to produce our own PNGase F, using <em>E.coli</em> bacteria transformed with the <em>Elizabethkingia miricola</em> PNGase F gene.</p>
<p>After ten days of work, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3263902#.XRj3jXt7l2Y">we obtained our stripper from outer space</a>, and were able to confirm its activity. Watch this less-than-outer space for the next experiments in which we shall try and grow our crystals again, this time with the protein without glycans!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inter-domain conformational mobility of UGGT, the eukaryotic secretion glycoprotein folding checkpoint, is likely key to its ability of recognising and re-glucosylating a vast number of different misfolded glycoproteins, bearing N-linked glycan(s) at various different distances from the site(s) of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28739903">misfold.<br />
</a></p>
<p>Ongoing Molecular Dynamics simulations by <a href="http://www.iquibicen.fcen.uba.ar/investigador/marcelo-marti/">Juan Blanco, Carlos Modenutti, and Marcelo Martí</a> in Buenos Aires have highlighted a motion called clamping, which brings the TRXL1 and the TRXL3 domains of UGGT close together. To test the importance of this clamping motion we have engineered a double Cys mutant of <em>Chaetomium thermophilum</em> UGGT (aka <em>Ct</em>UGGT) which locks the clamping motions shut: S180C:T742C. This mutant is called <em>Ct</em>UGGT-N for short.</p>
<p>The cloning, protein expression and purification were successful. Mass spectrometry confirmed the existence of the desired disulphide bond. We have managed to crystallise the <em>Ct</em>UGGT-N protein in two distinct crystal forms and we have determined <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1345671#.W3Q61X4nYfw">the structures</a>.</p>
<p>In the trigonal form, the orientation of TRXL2 with respect to the rest of the protein is the most opened ever observed so far (a rotation of 60 degrees away from the TRXL2 in <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5NV4">PDB ID 5NV4</a>). The orthorhombic form proves that the clamped shut structure (<em>Ct</em>UGGT-N P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>) is compatible with the bent shut structure (<em>Ct</em>UGGT<img class="size-medium wp-image-1728 alignleft" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4-350x263.jpg 350w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4-780x586.jpg 780w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4-250x188.jpg 250w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Slide4.jpg 841w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />-H, P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>, PDB ID 5NV4) <em>i.e.</em> both clamping and bending movements can close at the same time. A quadruple <em>Ct</em>UGGT mutant, containing both D611C:G1050C and S180C:T742C, should be feasible and its human UGGT1 equivalent could provide the best rigidification of the human structure conceivable so far &#8211; in order to aid crystallisation and obtain the so far elusive human protein crystal structure.</p>
