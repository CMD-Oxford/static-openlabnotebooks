				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/collecting-hao1-crystal-structures-with-follow-up-compounds-based-on-fragment-hits/">last post</a>, I told you I had soaked my follow-up compounds into HAO1 crystals to start developing structural explanations of how these compounds work. So far I have analysed four interesting protein-compound structures: 2 at the active site, 1 at the gating loop and 1 at the oligomeric interface.</p>
<p>The first structure had a compound derived from fragment 1 bound at the active site. This compound (5-bromo-N-methyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide; FUP1A for short) expands fragment 1 in two directions: adding a bulky, hydrophobic bromine to the aromatic ring and adding a methyl (CH<sub>3</sub>) to the carboxamide (CO-NH) at the other end of the molecule (figure 1C). FUP1A shows more typical displacement of the substrate-coordinating tryptophan (Trp110), rotating this residues by 180° so that it points away from the substrate binding pocket (figure 1A). FUP1A binds further into the substrate binding pocket than the fragment, likely due to the addition of the bulky bromine, so that it is now in the same orientation as the published HAO1 inhibitors (CDST and CCPST, PDB codes <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2RDT">2RDT</a> and<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6GMC"> 6GMC</a> respectively) as illustrated in figure 1D.</p>
<p>When taken together with the potent activity assay result – an IC50 of 62 µM, 7X improvement over fragment 1 – for a similar compound (6-bromo-N-ethyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide; FUP1B; structure shown in figure 1D) with the bromine one position away and a longer extension (ethyl, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, rather than methyl) on the other side, this structure opens up some interesting questions. Does the orientation of fragment 1 reflect a more optimal position for the core scaffold? If so, does the ethyl group and/or the different position of the ethyl group of FUP1B allow it to maintain this position? Or do one or both of these groups disrupt the active site residues in an entirely different way? To answer these questions, I am currently working to obtain a structure with FUP1B bound.</p>
<p>The second structure was with a compound derived from fragment 2, also at the active site. This compound (6-amino-1-benzyl-5-(methylamino) pyrimidine-2, 4(1H, 3H)-dione; FUP2A) was chosen to explore alternate groups for the second half of fragment 2, replacing the original ring (cyclohexane) with an aromatic one (benzene), since the former did not seem to contribute to fragment binding. FUP2A did not show much improvement in the activity assay over fragment 2 and this is reflected by the bound structure, which shows that FUP2A and fragment 2 bind in very similar poses with the same displacement of Trp110 (figure 1B). As well as validating this scaffold as a consistent HAO1-binder, this follow up structure suggests that the best way to continue development would be to expand from other positions on the substituted ring, to better disrupt active site residues.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2733" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig1-1024x553.png" alt="" width="780" height="421" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig1-1024x553.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig1-300x162.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig1-768x414.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

Comparison of FUP1A (purple) and FUP2A (yellow) with the published inhibitors, CDST (green) and CCPST (orange), shown as sticks.</em></p>
<p>The third structure is of a compound bound at the gating loop and derived from fragment 5 (figure 2B). This compound (2-((4H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl) thio)-1-(4-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazin-1-yl) ethan-1-one; FUP5A) replaces the fluoride on the original phenyl ring with a chloride at a different position (4-fluoro to 3-chloro) and extends the opposite end of the compound with a sulphur and a nitrogen-rich aromatic ring (triazole) (Figure 3B). FUP5A superimposes fairly well with its parent fragment at the piperazine (six-membered, non-aromatic ring with a nitrogen at either end) with the piperazine displacing the sidechain of Tyr134 and the substituted phenyl ring continuing to disrupt the gating loop (Figure 2A). the extension at the opposite end of the molecule does not cause the same conformational change (shift of helix 4) but rather points mostly out towards the solvent, not forming further interactions with the protein (Figure 3A). This structure suggests that larger extensions from the phenyl end may be more effective in disrupting the gating loop but care is needed in extending the other end of the molecule to avoid losing efficiency by including non-interacting chemical groups.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2735" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig2-1024x542.png" alt="" width="780" height="413" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig2-1024x542.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig2-300x159.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig2-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

<p>The final structure has a compound derived from fragment 6 bound at the subunit interface. This compound (1-(5-chloro-pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-(pyridin-2-yl)-piperazine; FUP6A) extends the fragment scaffold, essentially in a straight line, by the addition of two further rings and the structure shows that it binds in the same manner –  through hydrophobic interactions with both subunits and pi-stacking with the ring of Tyr163 on one subunit (figure 3A). The fact that FUP6A can bind with the HAO1 tetramer intact explains why it did not show much inhibition in the activity assay and this structure also helps to further map the binding pocket at the interface. Taken together with the more potent follow up compounds (e.g. FUP6B, FUP6C, shown in figure 3B), this structure validates the need for bulky additions perpendicular to the core scaffold (like the two fluorides in FUP6B) to more effectively disrupt the HAO1 tetramer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2734" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig3-1024x782.png" alt="" width="780" height="596" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig3-1024x782.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig3-300x229.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig3-768x587.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/post9-fig3.png 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><b>Figure 3: New structure of interface site inhibitor of HAO1. </b>A. Fragment 6 (purple) and the related compound, FUP6A (green). B. Chemical structures of interesting compounds.</em></p>
<p>Since some compounds may require greater movements of the gating loop or tetramer subunits than can be freely accommodated within preformed crystals, I am also trying to co-crystallise with the most promising hits. This involves adding one compound per aliquot of freshly purified HAO1 protein before setting up trials to screen a wide range of crystallisation conditions. Co-crystallisation experiments requiring more time and resources than soaking but do have a few benefits: a greater number of conditions can be tested to look for those that only yield crystals with a given ligand; a lower concentration of compound can be used to achieve an equivalent saturation of the protein; and binding of the compound occurs <em>in solution,</em> accommodating a greater degree of flexibility. To this end, I have set up crystal plates with the 13 top compounds (4 active site, 6 gating loop and 3 interface), which have yielded a number of likely-looking crystals that I will be screening over the coming weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A belated Happy New Year everyone!  It has been a good while since my last post so I wanted to update you on what I have been spending 2019 on so far.</p>
<p>After identifying some really promising follow-up compounds in my activity assay, the next step was to find out how they bind to HAO1, as illustrated in figure 1. Specifically I want to know how different chemical constituents of the new compounds interact with and/or cause conformational changes to amino acids within the HAO1 structure. By understanding which groups improve binding (e.g. that stabilise the bound state by interacting with nearby amino acids), which group increase inhibition (e.g. by disrupting active site residues like Trp110) and which groups are not required for the compound to work (i.e. no apparent interaction with the protein), we can rationally design compounds that combine the most effective chemical groups to make more potent inhibitors.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that I have made &gt;250 HAO1 crystals and soaked each of my follow up compounds twice (127 compounds times 2 crystals each = 254 crystals soaked). This duplication helps ensure complete coverage of all compounds (e.g. if one replicate is not mounted/collected correctly) and also improves confidence in my results i.e. if I see the same compound making the same interactions in two independent structures, I feel confident that the interactions I see are significant changes dependent on compound-binding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again! A few posts ago (<a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/analysis-of-fragments-that-bind-to-hao1/">here</a>), I presented one fragment bound at the interface between two subunits of the HAO1 tetramer (figure 1 will refresh your memory). Our idea to optimize this fragment into an inhibitor would be to make it bigger so that it disrupts the HAO1 tetramer. I would expect this to reduce HAO1 activity either directly (if HAO1 is more active as a tetramer and/or the compounds change the conformation of the tetramer), or indirectly, as disrupting the tetramer could reduce the stability of HAO1 protein.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Figure 1: Fragment 6 binds at the interface between two subunits of the HAO1 tetramer. </strong>A. Location of fragment binding in relation to the HAO1 tetramer. B. Surface model showing fragment binds in pocket between two subunits. C. Ribbon and stick model showing fragment 6 interacts with both subunits, displacing R341 (subunit 1) and pi stacking with Y163 (subunit 2).</em></p>
<p>With help from Tamas Szommer in <a href="https://www.brennanresearchgroup.com/">Paul Brennan’s group</a> at SGC, I synthesized a small set of fifteen bulky compounds based on the fragment scaffold. I wanted to preserve the aromatic ring (called a pyrimidine because of its two nitrogens), which engages in pi stacking with one subunit of HAO1, and the chlorine substituent, which displaces an arginine on the other subunit, to try to ensure that the compounds still bind to the same place, while replacing the five-membered, oxygen-containing ring (called a tetrahydrofuran) with larger substituents.</p>
<p>To synthesize this set of compounds, I employed a common chemical reaction, called nucleophilic aromatic substitution, to replace one chlorine in a dichloro-pyrimidine with the amine (-NH) group of various building blocks. I chose 15 compounds that were diverse in structure and greater than 150 Daltons in size (a tetrahydrofuran is 72 Daltons) to make my building blocks. In this reaction (shown in figure 2), a nucleophilic group (in this case the amine of the building block, R1-NH-R2) is added to an aromatic ring, delocalising the electrons and forming an intermediate known as the Meisenheimer complex. Then, the halogen atom (in this case the second chlorine) is eliminated from the ring, allowing it to return to its preferred, lower energy, aromatic conformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Inset: Meisenheimer complex intermediate. B. 15 building blocks selected based on size, diversity and inclusion of a free amine (NH or NH2).</em></p>
<p>I first tested my new compounds for inhibition of HAO1 using my fluorescence-based activity assay (as described in <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/screening-follow-up-compounds-from-active-site-and-gating-loop-hao1-fragment-hits/">my last post</a>). Of the 15 compounds, only three inhibited more than 50% of HAO1 activity at 1 mM, allowing IC50 determination. The best compound, SM001-10, has an IC50 of 86 uM. Some compounds showed no inhibition at all at 1 mM and this is also useful in determining how (not) to expand the ‘good’ compounds. More details about the synthesis and assaying of these compounds can be found on my Zenodo post <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2341173">here</a>.</p>

Extensions that did not result in inhibition of HAO1. C. Structure and IC50 results for the three compounds showing significant inhibition of HAO1 at less than 1 mM concentration.</em></p>
<p>We need two more pieces of information to guide the development of these compound towards inhibitors of HAO1: (1) x-ray crystal structures to tell us how exactly the compounds bind and what residues nearby we could expand the compounds towards to improve their activity; and (2) an assay that tells us more about <em>how</em> these compounds are inhibiting HAO1 activity i.e. do they disrupt the HAO1 tetramer? Or change the shape of the tetramer so that it is less effective at turning over the substrate?</p>
<p>I will tell you more about these in the New Year, until then – Happy holidays everyone!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/characterisation-of-hao1-fragment-hits-in-solution/">previous post</a>, I confirmed that the two active site fragments (fragments 1 and 2) and the gating loop fragment (fragment 5) bind to and inhibit HAO1 in solution. Next, I chose some larger compounds to test by entering each fragment hit structure into a search engine (<a href="https://www.emolecules.com/">emolecules.com</a>) to look for commercially available compounds that include the fragment within their structure. This resulted in 40 compounds based on the active site hits and 110 compounds expanding the gating loop hit.</p>
<p>Once the compounds arrived, I characterised them using the fluorescence-based (Amplex Red) activity assay that I described in my last post. After narrowing down my number of ‘good’ compounds by performing the assay at a single concentration (1 mM), I measured inhibition of these good compounds <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">at a range of concentrations to determine their <strong>IC50</strong> values – the concentration (of compound) at which the protein’s activity is reduced by 50% – to find out which compounds were most potent. I was able to determine reliable IC50s for 5 active site and 8 gating loop compounds (figure 1). You can find the experimental details in my Zenodo post <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1477079#.W-FvK5P7SUk">here</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Structures and IC50 values for most potent follow up compounds expanding fragments 1, 2 and 5.</em></p>
<p>The three ‘take-home’ messages from this assay are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potency of <strong>fragment 1</strong> can be increased 10-fold by growing the fragment in several directions &#8211; this indicates considerable potential for increased potency by growing in multiple directions at once.</li>
<li>Potency of <strong>fragment 2</strong> can be increased &gt;16-fold by removing the cyclohexane portion of the fragment. Such a high IC50 for so small a compound is very surprising – and very exciting!</li>
<li>A massive increase in potency (greater than 20-fold) can be achieved for <strong>fragment</strong> <strong>5</strong> by growing in either/both directions. It is encouraging that the most potent compounds are those that expand the core hit from both ends of the structure i.e. In towards the active site and out towards the protein surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next steps for this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry to make some follow-up (larger) compounds based on fragment 6, which binds at the HAO1 oligomer interface.</li>
<li>Test how the follow-up compounds for the oligomer interface behave in solution.</li>
<li>Use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure how tightly follow up compounds bind to HAO1. Particularly important for the active site fragment 2 compounds that are surprisingly potent for such small fragments (to ensure they are ‘real’ inhibitors and not e.g. aggregating the protein)</li>
<li>Soak the most promising compounds into HAO1 crystals to look at how they bind and help rationally design the next round of compounds.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/analysis-of-fragments-that-bind-to-hao1/">previous post</a>, I described four promising fragments bound to HAO1 structures.</p>
<p>Specifically, I described two key areas of HAO1 – the gating loop and active site Trp110 – where fragments 1, 2 and 5 bind. I also described fragment 6 at the subunit interface of HAO1, away from the active site.</p>
<p>After analysis of the fragment-bound structures, the next step is to determine how these four fragments affect the behaviour of HAO1 in solution. In this post, I will describe two biophysical assays: first, I tested whether binding of fragments could be detected in solution using surface plasmon resonance (SPR); and second, I tested whether the fragments were able to inhibit the activity of HAO1, using a fluorescence-based assay. You can find more details on Zenodo <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1344541">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Surface plasmon resonance confirmed binding of all four fragments to HAO1</strong></p>
<p>To confirm that the fragments are binders of HAO1 in solution, and not merely an artefactual crystal soaking observation, I used SPR. In SPR, the protein is immobilised onto a planar metal surface and a beam of polarised light is bounced off the surface. A solution containing the molecule of interest (in this case, varying concentrations of each fragment) is passed over the immobilised protein. When a fragment binds, this changes the intensity of light reflected at different angles – the amount this changes (the ‘response’) is directly proportional to the strength of binding (figure 1A).</p>
<p>Using SPR, we were able to confirm that all four fragments bind to HAO1 at fragment concentrations from 15 to 100 µM (figure 1B). However, due to the relatively small sizes of fragments, they bind too weakly for accurate dissociation constants (Kd) to be derived from a plot of response vs. fragment concentration.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1979" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post5_fig1-1024x759.png" alt="" width="780" height="578" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post5_fig1-1024x759.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post5_fig1-300x222.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post5_fig1-768x569.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post5_fig1.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Surface plasmon resonance assay to detect binding of HAO1 fragment hits in solution. A. Principle of surface plasmon resonance B. Results for four selected fragments.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fluorescence-based coupled enzyme assay confirmed inhibition of HAO1 by fragments 1, 2 and 5</strong></p>
<p>To measure HAO1 enzyme activity, I used the production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) from molecular oxygen by HAO1 when it converts glycolate to glyoxylate. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>production can be monitored by coupling to hydrogen peroxidase, which uses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to convert a colourless chemical, Amplex Red, to a fluorescent dye, resorufin (figure 2A). The level of fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>– and so the amount of glyoxylate – produced, allowing us to compare how active HAO1 is in the presence or absence of the fragments.</p>
<p>Using this coupled assay, I confirmed that the two active site fragments and the gating loop fragment inhibit HAO1 activity (figure 2B). As expected, the two active site fragments were the most potent, inhibiting up to 85% (fragment 1) and 37% (fragment 2) of HAO1 activity at the maximum tested concentration (10 mM fragment). The gating loop fragment (fragment 5) also showed detectable inhibition of HAO1 (19%) at this concentration. No inhibition was observed with the interface fragment (fragment 6), which makes sense since the fragment is too distant from the active site for direct competitive inhibition, yet is likely too small to disrupt the tetramer and HAO1 activity indirectly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/identifying-fragments-that-bind-to-hao1-by-x-ray-crystallography/">previous post</a>, I introduced our fragment screening results on HAO1. Specifically, I told you that we identified five promising fragment hits, from a little over 400 collected structures, clustering to three biologically relevant sites: the active site (fragments 1 and 2), the gating loop (fragment 5) and the subunit interface (fragments 6 and 7). In this post, I will go into a bit more detail about what these fragment-bound structures inform us about HAO1 as a drug target. You can find out more in the Zenodo document<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1344541#.W6Zm8U1wZbM"> here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Previous HAO1 structural information is important for drug discovery</strong></p>
<p>Two key features of the structure of HAO1 are important for the understanding of our data: the gating loop (figure 1A) and tryptophan 110, an active site residue that coordinates the substrate (figure 1B). Both features contribute to the biochemical characteristic of HAO1: it can metabolise a broad variety of substrates, ranging from the 2-carbon glycolate to the 16-carbon 2-hydroxypalmitate.</p>
<p>The gating loop (aa 169-212), often referred to as ‘loop 4’ due to its position between the fourth beta sheet and the fourth alpha helix, is highly flexible, as demonstrated by the variable orientation and degree of disorder observed in the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&amp;qrid=42713EC8">published crystal structures</a>, and is poorly conserved in sequence between members of the hydroxy-acid oxidase protein family.</p>
<p>Similarly, tryptophan 110, in contrast to the other residues in the active site, varies between family members: enzymes that prefer bigger substrates have a smaller residue at this position. In HAO1, tryptophan 110 is very flexible and can either point in towards the active site to metabolise the very small substrate glycolate or rotate outwards to bind larger substrates (or inhibitors). For a more detailed explanation of these structural features, including the movement of tryptophan 110 upon inhibitor binding, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi701710r">check out this paper.</a></p>

Residues that coordinate the substrate are shown as sticks. Distances from glycolate are in Angstrom. FMN is shown as spheres.</em></p>
<p><strong>HAO1 shows considerable binding plasticity</strong></p>
<p>The active site (fragments 1 and 2) and gating loop (fragment 5) fragments have an induced fit binding mode, causing conformational changes in nearby residues and, most notably, in the gating loop when they bind (figure 2). We can exploit this binding site plasticity when designing optimised inhibitors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1906" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure2.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure2.png 800w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure2-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure2-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Movement of gating loop and key active site residues by fragments 1, 2 and 5 (PDB IDs 5QIH, 5QIB and 5QIC respectively).</em></p>
<p><strong>Analysis of the active site hits (fragments 1 and 2)</strong></p>
<p>Fragment 1 contains a polar head group attached to a five-membered ring, similar to published inhibitors. However, the binding position of fragment 1’s five-membered ring is different and so may still yield novel inhibitors.</p>
<p>The structure with fragment 2 is a little puzzling as only the unsubstituted ring seems to interact with the protein and yet its binding causing significant conformational change: the gating loop is further from the substrate-binding position than in any other structure and tryptophan 110 has rotated by 180 degrees, out of the active site.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1907" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure3-1024x609.png" alt="" width="780" height="464" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure3-1024x609.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure3-768x457.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post4-figure3.png 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

<p><strong>Analysis of gating loop hit</strong></p>
<p>The key lesson here is the discovery of a novel, druggable pocket, bound with fragment 5. This is exciting because inhibitors that target an enzyme’s active site frequently suffer from specificity problems, inhibiting enzymes other than the target, since the active sites of enzymes with similar functions (in this case, flavin-dependent oxidation) are often very similar in structure. Inhibitors targeting this new pocket – which is not conserved in sequence between similar proteins &#8211; are much more likely to be specific to HAO1 alone. This is great news for drug development as increasing specificity proportionally decreases off-target drug actions that result in unwanted, sometimes serious, side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Fragments at the subunit interface</strong></p>
<p>Of the two fragments (fragments 6 and 7) at the subunit interface, only fragment 6 was sufficiently buried between the two subunits to be promising for further development. Given the small size of the fragment, it would be unlikely to disrupt the protein tetramer (and so HAO1 activity). Rather, fragment 6 will need to be grown to confer inhibitory activity. Another complication is that tetramer units contribute to the crystal arrangement of HAO1 and so highly ordered crystals are likely to be incompatible with compounds that effectively disrupt tetramer formation i.e. compounds either will not bind or will damage the crystal upon binding. This means that an alternative method will be required to analyse the binding modes of successful hits at this site.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I would like to share my recent work on HAO1 fragment screening by crystallography, as a means to identify inhibitor starting points.</p>
<p>So why fragment screening by x-ray crystallography? Well there are two components to my method of choice:</p>
<p><strong>Fragments instead of complex compounds provide good starting chemistry</strong></p>
<p>Fragments are less than 300 Daltons in size, in contrast to the larger, more complex compounds conventionally used in high throughput screening. This <a href="http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/ppebio/61/5/495.full.pdf">review</a> summarizes the merits of using fragments for drug discovery, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few hundred fragments explore the same diversity of chemical groups – ‘chemical space’ – as several hundreds of thousands conventional compounds;</li>
<li>Fragments are more efficient in scanning for potential binding pockets on a protein’s surface; and</li>
<li>Fragments can be readily optimised by growing, linking or merging multiple hits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Screening using x-ray crystallography provides direct binding information</strong></p>
<p>Due to their small size and low complexity, the binding of fragments to a protein target could be weak, hence a sensitive method for detection that also provides detailed information on the fragment binding mode would be desired – for this we turn to x-ray crystallography.</p>
<p>While x-ray crystallography has been a valuable tool in drug discovery for the past 2-3 decades, mainly to validate binding of hits identified from biophysical screening assays, applying it as a primary screen is less well established, and would require a more high-throughput setup. This is now made possible by the ‘XChem’ facility at beamline I04-1 of <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About.html">Diamond Light Source</a>, which has implemented a number of automation technologies (Figure 1), allowing screening of up to a thousand fragments in as little as a week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fragments are rapidly dispensed to crystals by sound waves (ECHO acoustic liquid handling)</li>
<li>Crystals are mounted with the help of the Shifter, a robot-assisted microscope stage</li>
<li>Data collection and initial processing (<a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Common/Common-Manual/Data-Analysis/Automated-Software-Pipeline.html">Xia2</a>) is entirely automated</li>
<li>The XChemExplorer software suite – automatically calculate electron density maps, generate protein models (<a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I03/I03-Manual/Data-Analysis/Automated-Software-Pipeline/Dimple.html">DIMPLE</a>), and scan for potential positives (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15123">PanDDA</a>) for all datasets in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: High throughput x-ray crystallography: the ‘XChem’ pipeline.</em></p>
<p><strong>HAO1 is particularly suited to screening by x-ray crystallography</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to earlier work <a href="https://www.thesgc.org/structures/2NZL">here</a> at SGC Oxford in crystallising HAO1, I already have a good start procedure for making crystals for fragment soaking</li>
<li>Previous <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&amp;qrid=7545BA70">crystal structures</a> have provided data on several ligand-dependent conformations of HAO1</li>
</ul>
<p>My first goal was to find a HAO1 protein construct and crystallisation condition that consistently gave lots (hundreds!) of high quality crystals. From testing a nested series of constructs with varying domain boundaries (figure 2), I found that the HAO1<sub>1-368</sub> protein readily generates several hundreds of reproducible crystals suitable for soaking.</p>
<p>After collecting high resolution data (1.2 – 1.8 Å) from 409 fragment-soaked crystals, the PanDDA software identified 17 bound fragments, of which five were in biologically relevant pockets of the protein.</p>
<p>You can read an in depth description of how the crystal system was set up and the fragment screen performed, as well as the experimental protocols, in the Zenodo document <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1344541#.W4xtAOhKiUk">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Development of a robust crystal system to support HAO1 fragment screen</em></p>
<p>The five interesting hits clustered to three sites (figure 3): the active site (fragments 1 and 2), the gating loop at the entrance of active site (fragment 5), and the subunit interface of the HAO1 tetramer (fragments 6 and 7).</p>
<p>In my next post, I will describe more on analysing and triaging the fragment hits for biophysical validation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody! I am Sabrina, a third year DPhil student in <a href="https://www.thesgc.org/groupprofile/9491">Wyatt Yue’s lab</a> at the SGC University of Oxford, co-supervised by <a href="https://thesgc.org/groupprofile/9496">Paul Brennan</a>. I am fascinated by how a single base change in an enzyme-coding gene can lead to a diverse group of symptoms and how the severity of such diseases can be reduced by the provision of missing, or reduction of accumulating, components. My project aims to look at how these approaches can apply to developing therapy for metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>In this first post, I would like to share the background of my research project:</p>
<p><strong>Primary hyperoxalurias are liver defects with kidney manifestations</strong></p>
<p>Primary hyperoxalurias are rare genetic disorders caused by inherited mutations in one of three liver enzymes responsible for detoxifying glyoxylate, a normal metabolite produced during amino acid breakdown and production (figure 1).  When glyoxylate is not metabolised, it accumulates and is converted to insoluble oxalate which is transported to the kidneys for excretion where it is deposited as calcium oxalate crystals (kidney stones), causing progressive kidney damage.</p>
<p>The most common and severe primary hyperoxaluria is type 1 (PH1), caused by mutations in alanine: glycine aminotransferase (AGXT), the liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme that converts glyoxylate and alanine to glycine and pyruvate.  In patients with PH1, complete kidney failure generally occurs by 30 years of age, with a subset of patients (around 10%) reaching end stage renal failure in infancy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1808" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure1-1-1024x500.png" alt="" width="780" height="381" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure1-1-1024x500.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure1-1-300x146.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure1-1-768x375.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure1-1.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Types of primary hyperoxaluria and glyoxylate metabolism.</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Substrate reduction therapy could address an unmet need for PH1</strong></p>
<p>To date the only treatment able to permanently arrest the decline of kidney function in PH1 patients is a combined liver and kidney transplant. Given the limited availability and high associated morbidity of transplantation, alternative therapeutic approaches are desperately needed. We propose that a substrate reduction approach could meet this need.</p>
<p>The aim of substrate reduction therapy, as the name suggests, is to slow the formation of the substrate that accumulates in the disease state, by inhibiting an upstream enzyme. This concept has been neatly illustrated using the analogy of turning down a tap to avoid overflowing a slow draining sink (check it out <a href="https://www.ntsad.org/index.php/component/fsj_faqs/faq/35-how-does-substrate-reduction-therapy-work">here</a>). In the 20 years since substrate reduction was first proposed for the treatment of Gaucher, a lysosomal storage disorder (<a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/45689/10719_2004_Article_BF00731489.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">Dr Norman Radin, 1996</a>), four substrate reduction drugs have been approved for clinical use in rare metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>I believe that substrate reduction is an attractive approach for PH1, because the characteristic kidney damage is caused by accumulated glyoxylate, the substrate of the defective enzymes. In the peroxisome, glyoxylate is produced by the oxidation of glycolate by hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1), using FMN as a co-factor, and so inhibition of HAO1 should decrease glyoxylate, and subsequently oxalate, production (figure 2).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1805" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure3.png" alt="" width="627" height="561" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure3.png 627w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure3-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Potential for substrate reduction therapy to treat primary hyperoxaluria: Targeting HAO1 to reduce glyoxylate production in the peroxisome.</em></p>
<p>HAO1 is an excellent target for substrate reduction therapy because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients with inherited mutations reducing HAO1 function are asymptomatic i.e. HAO1 deficiency is a ‘non-disease’</li>
<li>RNAi knockdown of HAO1 has been shown to decrease oxalate levels in PH1 animal models, and patients (clinical trial of ALN-GO is ongoing)</li>
<li>The HAO1 protein has been well characterised biochemically and structurally over the past two decades</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the first crystal structure of HAO1 was solved <a href="https://www.thesgc.org/structures/2NZL">here at the SGC</a> back in 2006, providing insight into the enzyme’s oligomeric state (tetrameric; figure 3A), co-factor binding (canonical FMN binding protein fold; figure 3B) and active site architecture (figure 3C).</p>
