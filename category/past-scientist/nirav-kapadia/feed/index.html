				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, I co-authored a manuscript titled, “In depth analysis of kinase cross screening data to identify chemical starting points for inhibition of the Nek family of kinases” [<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/md/c7md00510e#!divAbstract">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/md/c7md00510e#!divAbstract</a>]. As a part of this manuscript we identified several chemical starting points that can be used for the design of narrow spectrum and potent Nek kinase inhibitors.</p>
<p>One compound of particular interest is <strong>Abbott 1141:</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-623 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture1-300x188.png" alt="" width="364" height="228" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture1-300x188.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture1.png 598w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Originally, designed as a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Abbott 1141 inhibits Nek4 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 80 nM. Based on the available selectivity data, this compound inhibits 15 out of the 131 kinases it was screened, with IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 300 nM. Furthermore, Abbott 1141 does not have any activity for Nek2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Structurally, Abbott 1141 has a simple 4-pyridine substituted benzamide backbone; where the pyridine ring acts as the hinge binding group. Another feature of this compound is the presence of a chiral 2-amino 1-phenylethyl unit. Considering the structural simplicity of this compound, we envisioned that with relatively simple chemistry and easily accessible building blocks a diverse library of compounds can be rapidly synthesized.</p>
<p><strong>Why Nek4?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nek4 is a member of the Nek family of kinases (Nek1 to Nek11).  There is very limited information known about the biological functions of Nek4. In 2010, Doles and co-worker showed that Nek4 deficiency is involved in microtubule homeostasis and either enhances or antagonizes the effect of drugs targeting microtubules. Recently Park and co-workers, showed that Nek4 is highly upregulated in lung and colon cancer and is associated with the apoptosis triggering tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in lung cancers.  [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=nek4%5BTitle%2FAbstract%5D">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=nek4%5BTitle%2FAbstract%5D</a>] Compared to other members of the Nek family especially Nek2, Nek4 is extremely understudied. Thus, in order to unravel the functions of Nek4 and understand its implications in diseases, a potent and selective Nek4 inhibitor is required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, we have initiated a systematic Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) study on this compound with the following aims:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Identify SAR trends with respect to potency at Nek4 and selectivity across the screenable kinome.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Identify narrow spectrum and potent Nek4 compounds.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Identify compounds and chemical starting points for other understudied kinases for the KCGS. [<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181585">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181585</a>]</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, due to the high homology between the Nek family members, another possible outcome of this project could be the identification of pan-Nek inhibitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The SAR approach that will be followed is shown below:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-624 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture2-300x110.png" alt="" width="542" height="199" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture2-300x110.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture2-768x281.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Picture2.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our initial steps in this project are:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To profile Abbott 1141 in a DiscoverX KINOMEscan assay to measure selectivity across the kinome.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To investigate the importance of the chiral center by synthesis and screening of <em>R</em>-Abbott 1141 and <em>rac</em>-Abbott 1141.</li>
<li>Synthesize and screen a negative control of Abbott 1141.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my next updates, I will discuss the synthesis of analogs to execute our SAR plan. Stay tuned!</p>
