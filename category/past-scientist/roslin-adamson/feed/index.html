				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve not posted in a while, mainly because things have been really busy, but good busy, as I now have 3 new datasets/structures, of ALK2 with M4K2118, M4K2149 and, amazingly, M4K2009. As you know, this is our lead candidate, which until now has not behaved very well in crystal trials, and it hasn’t been possible to get decent crystals. In my last post I told you how I had somehow managed to mix up the TNIK and ACVR1/ALK2 tubes when I was setting up the plates, and accidentally put ACVR1 into a coarse screen and TNIK into a fine screen for ACVR1. Well, after I got lovely big crystals for what I thought was ACVR1 with M4K3003, I sent them to the synchrotron, got beautiful data to 1.4 Å, phased it, and lo and behold! It was M4K2009 snugly fitted into the binding pocket (see the ligand density after molecular replacement below). Of course, I didn’t notice this was a trimethoxy containing compound (how??) before I excitedly emailed everyone to tell them I had M4K3003, and then had to retract … However, the story ends well as M4K2009 is really important.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2511" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="509" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009-768x432.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4k2009.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, I got data for M4K2149 (~2.6 Å), one of the amide head group containing compounds we’re interested to see, and M4K2118 (~1.4 Å), which is doing well in some of the other assays too. I’ve put the .mtz files <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2573142#.XGw9g-j7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo if you want to play with high resolution data, and some images below showing the ligand density and the ligands binding in the pocket. The amide head group of M4K2149 appears to preserve the water network in the pocket that we’ve observed in other structures, but as the resolution is too low for waters, we can’t tell til we get higher resolution data. Which hopefully will be this week, as I’ve grown some really pretty crystals for M4K2149 that I hope will diffract better. These appeared quite by accident again, as I’d designed a fine screen around the D5 well condition of my mega composite screen, but neglected to notice when I validated the screen that I’d put 10 x less ammonium sulphate in one row than intended – should have been 0.9 M, but ended up being 0.09 M. I should probably start calling myself ‘the accidental crystallographer’ at this rate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2509" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/M4K2118-2149.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve got some small crystals for M4K3007, another structure we really want, and some pretty ones for M4K2184, another amide head group compound. I’ve followed up the M4K3007, just waiting to see if anything appears, and will send the tiny ones to the synchrotron while waiting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2508" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png" alt="" width="849" height="478" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crystal-pics.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" /></p>
<p>I’m also very happy to say that our new M4K2117 crystal system for XChem fragment screening has worked very nicely so far, in the sense that the crystals are large and relatively robust and can handle soaking in low salt conditions as well as compounds with DMSO for a few hours. They then still diffract to around 1.2-1.8 Å, consistently in the same space group, C 1 2 1. This is a vast improvement over the previous system with LDN-193189. We did a solvent characterisation and pre-screen a couple of weeks ago with 100 crystals, and of the 20 or so hits we got, none was in the allosteric pocket we are looking for. This could be because of the 1.4 M ammonium sulphate and 0.2 M Na/K tartrate I have in there, which might prevent access of fragments to the pocket. Thus, using the remarkable shifter that Nathan Wright at SGC designed, we’ll be transferring loads of crystals from grow plates to low salt soak plates before doing the compound soaks this week, with the same 100 compounds, in order to check if the hit rate/location changes.</p>
<p>I will mention though, for anyone who may never have noticed this, the DMSO concentration in the protein solution for crystallisation is very important! I had previously been using Batch 1 of M4K2117 for my co-crystallisation, but it ran out so I used Batch 2, which was a 50 mM stock, as opposed to the previous 25 mM stock. The plates I set up with this, the same in every other way, gave showers of rather ugly, crunchy, small crystals. So I tried a few things – diluted the stock to 25 mM in DMSO and set up plates with that, with both lower and higher concentrations of protein (8 and 14 mg/ml along with the usual 10-11 mg/ml), as well as using the stock as is, with lower and higher protein concentrations. The lower stock concentrations brought back the big, perfect, beautiful crystals from before, the higher stock, no matter the protein concentration, gave ugly chunks and showers. The final concentration of compound was the same in all, so clearly the DMSO percentage is a very important factor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone and happy New Year! I really, really wanted to end the year on a high note in December before I went off on holiday, but as it turned out, I didn’t have enough time to set up 18 plates and write a blog post on the last day. So I’ll just have to start the year on a high note.</p>
<p>I’m very happy to say I got another ACVR1/ALK2 structure in December, at 2 Å resolution, co-crystallised with M4K2158 (see images below, and the .mtz autoprocessed file is available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo). The structure is not fully refined yet, but what’s interesting is the solvent side of the molecule is being stabilised by either a water contact (Chain A) or Asp293 (Chain B). This gives it really good density.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also seem to have some new <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">pretty </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">hits with M4K2118, M4K2149 and M4K3003 (crystal pics below). What’s interesting about the M4K3003 hits is that I’ve really struggled to get crystals with this compound (as well as M4K3007 and 3010), and it is a pretty desirable structure. These hits came about as a result of a mistake, where I somehow managed to mix up my tubes and put ACVR1 with M4K3003 into my mega composite screen without seeds, and TNIK into a fine screen I had intended for ACVR1 with seeds. I only discovered this because I mass specced the TNIK just before setting up the plates, then rushed off to do them as it was the SGC Christmas party that night and I needed to finish (best not to rush experiments). When I checked the mass spec result later, I got the exact mass of ACVR1! So I went back to the crystallography room and recovered what protein I could from the source plate for the TNIK plates, and mass specced it again. Same result – ACVR1. But when I looked at the drop images for those plates (now containing ACVR1 + M4K3003), I found a bunch of crystals! Happy serendipity!! These will go on the trip to Diamond on the 21</span><sup>st</sup><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> of January and then we’ll know whether the mistake really ended well or not. Fingers crossed!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2366" style="width: 893px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2366" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png" alt="" width="883" height="497" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crystal-hits-Dec_Jan-2018_9.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ACVR1 co-crystallised with M4K2149, 2118 and 3003 &#8211; hits to send to the synchrotron</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may well ask, why was I setting up plates with TNIK? As it happens, some of our collaborators’ assays show M4K2009, our main compound of interest, hits both TNIK and DDR1 with pretty high affinity. We’ve been struggling to get crystals of ACVR1 with M4K2009 – for whatever reason, it doesn’t want to make crystals. So it seemed like a good idea to see if TNIK or DDR1 will co-crystallise with it. TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK Interacting Kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an activator of the Wnt signalling pathway. DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) is a tyrosine kinase that functions as cell surface receptor for fibrillar collagen and regulates cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, differentiation, survival and cell proliferation (according to its GeneCard).</p>
<p>While I was about it, I thought it would be useful to set up plates with BMPR1A (ALK3), for the same reason I set up TGFBR1 (ALK5) before – to see what off-target structures look like with some of these compounds. The purification protocols for TNIK and BMPR1A were as standard, but they’re available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2531714#.XC94jlz7SUk">here</a> on Zenodo.</p>
<p>Some other good news is that I’ve figured out how to reproduce my XChem crystals fairly reliably. On the last day before the holidays I set up 6 plates of ACVR1 with M4K2117, which gives really beautiful, well-diffracting crystals. I used 10, 12 and 15 mg/ml protein, and made plates with and without seeds. Well, the ones without the seeds grew fabulously, within 2 weeks, and the ones with seeds didn’t! The next step with these then is to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. That&#8217;ll be for next week. Have a great weekend!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things have been really busy in the lab the last few weeks. I’ve done a couple of purifications of ACVR1 (ALK2), which I’ll post in <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1639900#.W_6-6Wj7SUk">Zenodo</a> (getting loads of protein now), but probably won’t write up the details of every purification every single time anymore, as it’s the same process every time for this construct. Please feel free to access earlier Zenodo posts for the protocol, or contact me and I’ll send you the links. I’ve also set up at least 50 crystal plates over the past month, most using the composite screen I made a while back, as well as follow up screens for hits in those conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven’t been lucky with other compounds again like I was with the big, beautiful M4K2117 crystals, but, after initial apparent abject failure to reproduce these, I now appear to have grown a plate of simply gorgeous beauties (about 40 wells with lovely crystals, which in theory should diffract around 1.5 Å or better) (see pics below, verified as protein with UV imaging). I’ve done this for the fragment screening side of the project, where we’re using x-ray crystallography to screen compound fragments in search of an allosteric binding site on ACVR1, as described in earlier posts. The crystal system I’ve been using is with LDN-193189 co-crystallised with ACVR1. The crystals are big and beautiful, but suffer from some issues: they give variable space groups, tricky for the pandda software to deal with, they have thick skins, which makes soaking somewhat variable and necessarily increases the soak time, as well as making mounting tricky. In many cases while mounting, I noticed the skin was formed almost as an envelope around the top and bottom of the drop, thus when you try to pull back the skin, it pulls the crystal with it and then wraps it up tightly in a big lump of sticky skin. I’m not that great at the micro-surgery needed to separate the mess out. Additionally, many of these crystals melt or become friable when soaked too long (more than ~2 hours).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The M4K2117 ACVR1 co-crystals however are in nice clear drops, although the conditions are very salty (0.1 M citrate pH 5.0 – 6.0, 1.4M ammonium sulphate, 0.2M sodium/potassium tartrate). This could be an issue for fragment binding – acidic conditions with lots of charged species around. Thus, I intend to test what happens if I soak them in different formulations of lower salt with and without some PEG3350. Also, I need to figure out how to grow them reproducibly, as only those 40 wells from one plate out of 6 set up actually grew. It’s unclear why 2 other plates the same conditions and 3 other plates with essentially the same condition didn’t grow. Or perhaps I just need to wait a little longer (they take about a month to grow).  Many of the wells without crystals have a lot of phase separation, as shown in the pic below as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I reported here a couple of weeks ago that I&#8217;d obtained datasets for ACVR1 bound to M4K2117 and M4K2121, at 1.25 and 2 Å resolution, respectively, and I put up a link to the data. I&#8217;m now refining the data and got some pretty good structures so far. These are what the current stats look like, below. There&#8217;s still some way to go with the refinement, but they look pretty good so far!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2129" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-1024x576.png" alt="" width="873" height="491" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats-768x432.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Structure-stats.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also made some pretty pictures of the bound ligands, some or which were used for the M4K progress meeting yesterday. As can be seen below, the water molecule co-ordinating two of the Os on the trimethoxyphenyl is there, as in previous structures, and this is coordinated by another water and Lys235. The interaction of the hinge region of both ligands with His286 is also there. The solvent side is uncoordinated in the M4K2117 structure, but there&#8217;s a water there in M4K2121, which is less mobile in that region anyway, so that is not too surprising. It&#8217;s truly fabulous how we can easily see in these structures the chemical space that can still be explored to fill up the pocket, but I&#8217;m acutely aware of how many other important criteria a drug candidate has to fulfil in order to actually do its job properly. Hopefully, with the excellent expertise we have working on this project in all the different areas needed to make an effective drug, the structural information will be of use. Now, I have some more compounds to screen &#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the week has been super busy, but all for good reasons this time!! I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled to say that amongst all the salt crystals I found in my crystal plates, I also found the crystals below, one of which diffracted to 1.25 Å. This is definitely the highest resolution I&#8217;ve ever worked with. It&#8217;s amazing! You can see everything &#8211; as shown in the pic below, phenix found the ligand quite easily. This was with M4K2117. The other two datasets I got were at about 2 Å, also really good, and they&#8217;re for M4K2121. Clearly the use of the composite screen I set up has increased the hit rate, and allowed me to screen a lot more compounds more quickly and at both room temperature and 4 degrees.</p>
<p>The link to the autoprocessed .mtz files is <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1475852#.W9mR4JP7SUk">here.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already set up 20 more plates with 10 more compounds &#8211; fingers crossed we get more crystals and more data! A brilliant end to a tough few weeks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in my last post, I got 26 mg of ACVR1 on my last purification (as shown in my Zenodo log <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1446500#.W7djZWhKiUk">here</a>).

In particular, one of these hits was in G10 of my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7dkR2hKiUk">composite screen</a>. I&#8217;ve therefore set up a lot of plates around this condition, and at the same time have mounted some of the crystals that were in those wells with different compounds, and will be screening them at the synchrotron tonight. The best outcome of course would be a dataset, but at least if they diffract ok I know I have something to work with, as the fine screens are showing some small, needly crystals which could probably be optimised a bit.</p>
<p>Wish me luck, and I&#8217;ll hopefully update on Monday!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that our workhorse ACVR1 construct is expressing again, I’m getting loads of protein – 26 mg on the last 3 L scale up! Because of this, I’ve been really busy in the lab trying to get things back up to speed again. While waiting for the ACVR1 to work, I purified some TGFBR1 (ALK5) for co-crystallisation with some of the less ALK2-specific compounds M4K has been providing us with. The protocol notes for that are <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7TDQGhKiUk">here</a>, but unfortunately, neither the short nor long constructs of TGFBR1 has provided us with any usable crystals so far, despite setting up many, many plates. If possible, I will farm some of the plates for seeds, but the reality is there was not much crystalline material in my TGFBR1 plates.</p>
<p>I also spent some time (and gained a few more grey hairs) designing and making a big composite screen of all our other coarse screens (5 in total). We are aware that screening a lot of compounds at two different temperatures in 5 screens, and then following up on hits from those screens is time and protein-intensive. We decided to make things a little more streamlined and efficient by looking at the conditions that ACVR1 typically crystallises in. Analysis of the 13 structures of ACVR1 in the PDB showed that most of them grew in conditions containing phosphate, citrate or sulphate. Thus, I pulled out all the phosphate, citrate and sulphate conditions in JCSG7, LFS6, HIN3, HCS3 and BCS6 and combined them all into one big 96-well coarse screen. The components of the screen are all in the Zenodo post <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7TDQGhKiUk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since I had a lot of fresh new ACVR1 – the purification protocol is <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443375#.W7TDQGhKiUk">here</a> – I set up 10 compounds at two different temperatures with this new screen, and got loads of hits (images below). Unfortunately, after UV imaging the plates, I discovered that all the big, beautiful, fabulous looking crystals I had picked in the ammonium phosphate/acetate condition, were salt. Crushing disappointment! So today I’ve made 3 more fine screens based on the ugly, needly, micro, spherulite-like hits I had in other conditions, that are in fact protein. I’ll document these screens tomorrow. With a huge dose of luck, I will have some prettier crystals by tomorrow morning, in time to mount them and send them to the synchrotron for our trip Friday evening. In the meantime, I’ll try to mount some of the less ugly ones from the coarse screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in recent posts, our workhorse ACVR1 constructs have, for mysterious reasons, stopped expressing. This is clearly a massive problem, as with no protein we can not progress the project, and in the meantime, another DIPG patient has died, <a href="http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20180818/girl-who-started-lemon-face-challenge-for-dipg-dies">Aubreigh Nicholas</a>, the 11-year-old girl who started the lemon face challenge. This is tragic, and exemplifies again the need for therapies against this cancer as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done a few 50 ml scale expressions with different viral levels and different virus amplifications in the past few weeks that have not worked at all. Last week Shubhashish Mukhopadhyay and Gavin Mckinley in our fantastic biotech team tried lowering the virus levels a lot &#8211; 4 x, 2 x and normal levels, on a 100 ml scale. <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/ellie-williams/">Ellie Williams</a> and I did parallel 50 ml purifications of these expression tests (documented <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1403148#.W4AdwuhKiUk">here</a>, in Zenodo), and they worked! We are so happy! Now we have to cross fingers that the expression will scale up to the litre scale again. I even got enough protein from this expression test to set up 5 plates with M4K3007, one of the compounds we are screening. There are no crystals in the 1-day images yet, but hopefully something will grow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will be on leave next week, but hopefully biotech will be able to grow up some protein for me next week or the week after, and I can get back to screening compounds and setting up trials for XChem fragment screening.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back with news of the scale-up.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of our “workhorse” protein, ACVR1 residues 208-499 (constitutively active Q207D mutant) (as we are still trying to work out why it won’t express at the moment), and the complete lack of crystals/diffracting crystals for the TGFBR1/FKBP12 complex, I have shifted to some other constructs we have to keep things moving. I had some purified short form R206H ACVR1 mutant (without the FKBP12 binding site) in the freezer, so I ran it over the gel filtration column again and set up crystal plates with M4K2009 and M4K3007. A few small, ugly crystals grew, which I screened at the synchrotron, but they didn’t diffract. I have another 2L pellet of this construct in my freezer, so will purify more and try it with some of the other compounds.</p>

<p>More recently (last week), I purified a shorter form of TGFBR1 (ALK5) (residues 198-503, instead of the longer form I’ve been using with the FKBP12 binding site, residues 162-503). Experimental details and compound structures are available <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1344540#.W3GSCuhKiUk">here</a>. This particular construct hasn’t been used in a while, but it expressed ok (baculo). The ultimate yield wasn’t fantastic (around 2.5 mg from 2 L cells), because it had to go through a nickel rebind step, increasing losses. I was able to set up 9 crystal plates with it, with 2 different compounds and 5 different coarse screens. Day 1 images show no crystals yet, but it’s still early days.</p>
<p>This week I intend to purify the long form Q207D ACVR1 mutant, and combine it with FKBP12 to screen for possible fragment screening conditions (since the synchrotron summer shutdown will be over next month), as well as co-crystallise more of the M4K compounds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sad to report that a couple of test expressions later, we&#8217;re still no wiser as to why ACVR1 isn&#8217;t expressing.

<p>In the meantime, I had some old purified ACVR1A (short form R206H mutant) (a different construct) in my freezer, so I put it on the gel filtration again and set up a few plates with it the other week with some of the M4K compounds (M4K2009, M4K3007). These made some crystals (kind of ugly crystals &#8211; see below), and I had some 2 month old TGFBR1/FKBP12 plates that had some really, really fine hair like crystals on them, so I mounted all these and sent them for screening. Sadly, nothing diffracted.</p>

<p>However, although not much is working in the lab at the moment, I did an outreach event on Saturday afternoon in Bonn Square in Oxford &#8211; this was Soapbox Science (<a href="https://www.iccs.org.uk/event/soapbox-science-oxford-2018">https://www.iccs.org.uk/event/soapbox-science-oxford-2018</a> and <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2018-oxford/">http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2018-oxford/</a> and @SoapboxScienceOxf). This event aims to showcase women scientists and their work, giving us the space to engage with the public about what we do. It was a huge amount of fun. People stayed for quite a long time to listen and ask questions, and we had some truly fascinating talks.</p>
