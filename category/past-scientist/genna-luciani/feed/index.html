				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again. My apologies for the delay in posting &#8211; I&#8217;ve been busy with other projects lately. As a follow up to my <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/finally-finding-an-antibody-to-detect-ezh1-protein-expression/">previous</a> post, we wanted to further confirm our EZH1 antibody and test it in a knockout line. To do this, we generated a CRISPR knockout of EZH1 in an AML cell line that will be a great tool for future experiments. To generate the knockout line, we were helped by Fraser Soares, a postdoctoral fellow in Hansen He&#8217;s lab. He provided us with an AML cell line (OCI-AML-3) that expresses Cas9, along with guide RNAs that would allow us to knockout EZH1. Once the knockouts were generated, we tested the expression of EZH1 and EZH2. We determined that the guides knocked out EZH1, but had no effect on related EZH2 expression levels (Figure 1). We can now conclude we have a specific EZH1 antibody and EZH1 knockout lines that we can use in the future. For full experimental details, please see <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2718713#.XNXV6TBKjIU">Zenodo</a> post.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: Western blot for EZH1 (green) and actin (red) with ~50ug protein loaded in HEK293 cells (293) and patient cells. A band of expected size (~85kDa) is seen in all samples except 150860 that we did not expect EZH1 expression.</p>
<p>Something else that I wanted to share was members of SGC Toronto (including other open notebookers <a href="http://labscribbles.com/">Rachel</a>, <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/mandeep-mann/">Mandeep</a> and <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/david-dilworth/">Dave</a>) recently participated in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada&#8217;s (LLSC) <a href="https://www.lightthenight.ca/about-us/">Light the Night Walk</a>. The walk is the LLSC&#8217;s annual fundraising event to raise money to support those impacted by blood cancers, as well as funding for leukemia and lymphoma research. LLSC is a great organization that funds my research at the <a href="http://www.llscanada.org/someday-is-today/stories/dr-cheryl-arrowsmith">SGC</a>, including the work posted on my open notebook. Through the generosity of our supporters, team SGC was able to raise over $2000 for LLSC! It was a truly memorable experience seeing all the lanterns lighting up the night in support of fighting blood cancers and I  definitely won&#8217;t forget the touching stories we heard from survivors, patients and their loved ones battling leukemia and lymphoma.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again! As a follow up to my previous <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/follow-up-to-finding-an-antibody-to-detect-ezh1-protein-expression-the-search-continues/">post</a>,I&#8217;ve continued the search for an antibody to detect EZH1. I&#8217;m happy to report that I finally found one. I was able to detect a band in HEK293 cells using the Cell Signaling Antibody. Using knockdowns targeting EZH1, I was able to determine that the band detected is specific to EZH1 (Figure 1). Compared with control knockdown, I see a decreased signal in the band that corresponds to EZH1 in size using both A7 and A9 knockdowns (Figure 1A) but not the related EZH2 protein (Figure 1B) with the A9 knockdown. A7 knockdown shows some decrease in EZH2 expression and is likely due to off target affect of the knockdown.  Full details are available on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1435780#.W6uYcntKjIU">Zenodo. </a></p>

This time I tested directly in patient sample lysates and either saw no band, or many nonspecific bands (Figure 1). I have since reached out to the Orlando lab who recently published a paper (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346433">PMID: 28346433</a>) where they looked at EZH1 expression levels by Western. A post doc in their lab (Peng Liu) informed me that they were also using the EZH1 antibody from Abcam that is no longer available, but recommended that I try a Cell Signaling Technologies antibody. That is what I will be doing next!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again! Here is my first attempt to find an EZH1 antibody. I have mainly focused on EZH2 in the <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/project-overview-testing-polycomb-repressive-complex-2-prc2-inhibitors-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/">PRC2</a> complex as the methyltransferase responsible for the H3K27me3 mark. However, EZH1 can functionally substitute for EZH2 in PRC2. We have a good antibody to detect EZH2 levels in patient AML samples. However, for some samples that we see detectable levels of H3K27me3 mark but no EZH2 expression, we suspect that EZH1 might be substituting for EZH2. We would like to get a good EZH1 antibody to determine expression levels of this protein in patient samples. I tested three antibodies for EZH1 using western blot, and despite some initial results of detecting a potential band for EZH1 in brain tissue with an Active Motif antibody (Figure 1A), we were unable to see it in patient cells (Figure 1B). Full experimental detail can be found on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1322109#.W1odstVKjIU">Zenodo</a>. Also listed in my experimental details is our plan moving forward to obtain an EZH1 antibody!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again! In <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/generation-of-fluorescently-labelled-op9-stromal-cells-for-growing-patient-leukemic-cells/">previous</a> <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/determining-cd34-expression-in-the-presence-and-absence-of-stroma/">posts</a> I talked about how we were using a co-culture system to grow our leukemic cells. Although this is a great way to maintain cells, it can complicate some analyses where we cannot distinguish mouse (stroma) from human (AML) cells. We wanted to determine H3K27me3 levels (the mark that EZH2 is responsible for) in the AML patient cells we are working with. Usually this can be performed using the western blots. However, the antibody for the mark recognizes both human and mouse H3K27me3. To overcome this, we wanted to see if we could determine H3K27me3 levels using flow cytometry where we can distinguish the human cells from the mouse cells using the human CD45 marker. Experimental details can be found at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1253386#.WwiN16QvzIU">Zenodo</a>.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Histogram of H3K27me3 levels in CD45 positive OCI-AML-20 with (EPZ6438; red and orange) and without (DMSO; blue and light blue) 7 days of EZH2 inhibitor treatment. Number of events (cells) is displayed, as well as median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for cell populations. Unstained show almost no fluorescence. DMSO treated cells show a substantial fluorescence signal that is greatly reduced in the presence of EZH2 inhibitor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again! I have written a summary report of how we are culturing patient leukemic cells using two patients as an example, 150333 and OCI-AML-20. The report can be found at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1186848#.WphD-oPwbIU">Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>We are monitoring the growth of cultured cells by looking at the expression of CD34 and CD38 markers over a number of weeks. These are important markers for leukemic stem cells (LSCs). LSCs are cells with the capacity to self-renew and give rise to progenitor cells. The LSCs are thought to be the cells that are responsible for relapse in AML. To be able to screen chemical probes, we would like to be able to maintain CD34 expression, a marker of LSCs (CD34+CD38- are often markers of LSCs). The epigenetic probes that we are using often require long term exposure, so we wanted to determine if we could maintain CD34 expression long term to be able to treat these cells with probes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our experiments use cells from patients with leukemia. These primary cells are notoriously difficult to culture, especially long term. To overcome this, we are using a co-culture system where we grow the leukemia cells with mouse stromal cells (OP9) to try to mimic some aspects of the bone marrow environment present in leukemia. Although essential for maintenance of leukemia cells, the stromal cells can complicate many of the analyses that are required to establish the effective targeting of the leukemia cells. To get around this, we introduced fluorescent markers in the OP9 cells to easily distinguish the stromal cells from the patient cells in various applications such as microscopy and flow cytometry.
