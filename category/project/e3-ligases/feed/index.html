										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>GID4 is the substrate-recognition subunit of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which has been shown to possess E3-ligase enzymatic activity (PIMID:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31885576">31885576</a>). GID4 was shown to bind proteins and peptides with a Pro/N-degron consisting of an unmodified N-terminal Pro and has the highest affinity for the peptide Pro-Gly-Leu-Trp (PIMID:29632410). In yeast Gid4 specifically targets the gluconeogenic enzymes (Fbp1, Icl1, and Mdh2) for proteasome-mediated degradation (PIMID: 31863529), however, substrate specificity for human GID4 has not been fully understood.</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>Cell-based thermal shift assays (CETSA) provide a native environment for measuring compounds’ target engagement and cell permeability. Standard western blot-based CETSA protocols are laborious, require high-quality antibodies to the target, and are generally not amenable to high-throughput compound screening. Therefore, we have adopted the HiBiT technology-based CETSA, which measures the thermal stability of a NanoLuc Luciferase fusion protein, to measure GID4 cellular target engagement in a 384-well plate format (Fig.1). The assay was validated with two compounds: 20964 and 12966, which showed significant dose-dependent stabilization of GID4 when tested <em>in vitro</em> by DSF. Using both compounds we observed reproducible stabilization of GID4 (Fig.2A) in cells. Since compound 20964 gave better T<sub>m</sub>-shift (∆T<sub>m</sub>), we tested if the stabilization is dose-dependent in a temperature range which gave the biggest difference between treated and untreated samples.  Compound 20964 showed the dose-dependent stabilization of GID4 (Fig.2B). The effect was significant at 1 µM concentration (Fig.2C). These results validate the utility of the HiBiT based CETSA assay to measure cellular target engagement of GID4.</p>

<p><strong>Fig.1. HiBIT protein tagging system</strong>. HiBiT is an 11 amino acid peptide tag that can be attached to the N or C terminus of the protein. The tag is detected with a reagent containing an inactive luciferase subunit, Large Bit (LgBiT), which rapidly binds to HiBiT to produce a functional NanoLuc luciferase enzyme that relies on the substrate furimazine to produce high intensity, glow-type luminescence.</p>

<p><strong>Fig.1. </strong><strong>Mammalian PRMTs. </strong>There are 9 members and 3 types of the PRMT family. Type I, II and III PRMTs catalyze the formation of monomethyl arginines (Rme1). Type I PRMTs catalyze asymmetric arginine methylation (Rme2a), while type II PRMTs form symmetric arginine methylation (Rme2s). Type III PRMT can only monomethylate arginine residues. Modified from (PMID:29378138).</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>It has been reported that the RNA polymerase II mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) and BAF155, are PRMT4 substrates (PIMID: 26601288, 25927994). Consistently with previous findings, PRMT4 knock-down decreased asymmetric dimethylation of MED12 and BAF155 (Fig.2). The assay was validated with PRMT4 selective chemical probe TP-064 (PIMID: 29719619). TP-064 decreased PRMT4 asymmetric dimethylation of MED12 (Z factor = 0.6) and BAF155 (Z factor = 0.76) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3).</p>

<p><strong>Fig.2. PRMT4 knock-down resulted in a decrease of MED12 and BAF155 asymmetric dimethylation (Rme2a) levels. </strong>HEK293T cells were treated with siRNA for 3 days and 6 days. The levels of methylation were analyzed in Western Blot.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Fig. 3.</strong> <strong>TP-064 </strong><strong>decreases PRMT4 dependent MED12 and BAF155 asymmetric dimethylation (Rme2a) levels.</strong> HEK293T cells were treated with PRMT4 selective inhibitor (TP-064) at indicated concentrations for 48 h and BAF155-Rme2a (A) and MED12-Rme2a (B) levels were determined by Western blot. The graphs represent nonlinear fits of methyl signal intensities normalized to total protein levels. The results are mean +/- SEM of 3 replicates.</p>
