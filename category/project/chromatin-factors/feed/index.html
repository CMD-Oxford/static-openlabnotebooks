<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>WDR5 belongs to the WD-repeat protein family and is an important component of various complexes, including SET1/MLL, NuRD, and NSL complex. It interacts with several binding partners via the &#8220;WDR5-interacting&#8221; (Win) site (e.g. symmetrically dimethylated histone H3R2, MLL1-4, SET1-2) or &#8220;WDR5-binding motif&#8221; (WBM) site (e.g. c,l,n-MYC, RBBP5). WDR5 emerged as a prime target for anti-cancer therapy due to its important roles in gene transcription, proliferation, and self-renewal (PIMID 29385767).</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>Assay measuring the interaction of WDR5 with histone H3 was developed using NanoBRET technology &#8211; a proximity-based assay that can detect protein interactions by measuring energy transfer from a bioluminescent protein donor to a fluorescent protein acceptor. We tested different donor (N- or C-terminally NanoLuc® tagged WDR5) to acceptor (C-terminally HaloTag®Fusion-tagged histone H3.3) ratios in two different cell lines (U2Os and HEK293T). The assay was validated with WDR5 Win site antagonist &#8211; OICR9429 (PIMID:2695870). The best NanoBRET ratio and the greatest compound effect was obtained in U2Os cells transfected with 0.01 ug of C-terminally HaloTag®Fusion-tagged histone H3.3 and 0.001 µg of C- terminally NanoLuc® -tagged-WDR5 per 96-well (Fig.1).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The mammalian MYST1 is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases and is the primary enzyme that catalyzes the acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16). Acetylation of K16 is a prevalent mark associated with chromatin decondensation. MYST1 has been shown to play an essential role in embryonic formation and development, chromatin assembly, transcription activation, cellular apoptosis, double‐strand break repair, cellular stress response, and tumorigenesis (PMID:24452550, 26387537, 17967868, 24452485).</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>It was shown that MYST1 participates in at least two distinct multiprotein complexes (MSL and NSL) in human cells. Both complexes can acetylate H4K16; however, the NSL complex possesses broader substrate specificity and can also acetylate histone H4 at K5 and K8 (PMID:26784169).  Consistent with previous findings, the overexpression of MYST1 led to an increase in total lysine acetylation levels and acetylation of H4K16 on exogenous (GFP-tagged) as well as endogenous histone H4 (Fig.1 and 2). Due to high basal H4 acetylation levels, only a small increase in acetylation was observed upon MYST1 overexpression in endogenous H4 (Fig.2), making the system with exogenous histone H4 preferential assay for compounds screening. The assay was additionally validated with MYST1 catalytic mutant (K274R), which overexpression in contrast to WT MYST1 did not alter basal exogenous H4 acetylation levels (Fig1).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently, I have started working on NanoBret PPI technology for chromatin factors and E3 ligases are here is one of the assays I developed.</p>
<p><strong>Background (source: PMID28179136).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The repressive Nucleosome Remodeling and histone Deacetylation (NuRD) complex alters chromatin structure by coupling ATP-dependent remodeling activity with histone deacetylation function. It is composed of six different types of subunits: Metastasis Associated (MTA) proteins MTA1/2/3,  HDAC1/2, histone chaperone RBBP4/7 forming a complex, as well as CpG-binding protein MBD2/3, p66α/β and includes the peripheral association of the ATP-dependent helicase CDH3/4. RBBP4 and RBBP7 are seven-blade β-propeller WD40 proteins that bind MTA through the same surface as histone H4, and therefore RBBP4/7 only bind histone H3 and not H4 in the complete NuRD complex. The Stoichiometry of the MTA1-RBBP4 complex is 2:4 (Fig 1).</p>

<p><strong>Fig.2. The tag positions in RBBP4, RBBP7, and MTA2 are indicated. HT-HaloTag, NL-NanoLuc</strong></p>
<p>I determined the optimal donor to acceptor ratio of donor constructs: C- or N-terminally NanoLuc tagged RBBP4 and RBBP7 and acceptor constructs: C- or N-terminally HaloTag tagged MTA2 (Fig.3). The best results were obtained at 1:100 donor to acceptor ratio for C- terminally NanoLuc® tagged RBBP4 or RBBP7 and C- terminally HaloTag tagged MTA2 (Fig 3).</p>

<p><strong>Fig 3. NanoBRET assay development for MTA2 and RBBP4 or RBBP7 interactions. </strong>U2Os cells were transfected with different donor to acceptor ratios, as indicated, and signal was read 48 h post transfection. Experimental duplicates of mean corrected NanoBRET ratios (mBU) are indicated.</p>
<p>We also compared the RBBP4 and RBBP7 binding to H3 at the optimized donor and acceptor plasmid ratios established above. RBBP4 and RBBP7 displayed more consistent binding to MTA2 than H3. Further experiments employing binding disrupting mutants or compounds are needed for assay validation and assay window determination.</p>
