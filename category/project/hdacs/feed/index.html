										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to share with you the details for cellular assay detecting interaction between histone deacetylase HDAC6 and ubiquitin, which is a unique property within the histone deacetylase family.</p>
<p>HDAC6 is a member of the histone deacetylase family which deacetylate lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. It plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes such as cell signaling, autophagy, and trafficking (PIMID:30176876, 22069321). HDAC6 is composed of two catalytic domains as well as a unique zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). HDAC6 was shown to bind C-terminal RLRGG peptide present in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) via the UBD, which is an important step for misfolded proteins degradation (PIMID:29741882), autophagy, trafficking and other processes (PIMID:30176876, 22069321). By binding to polyubiquitinated or ISGylated protein aggregates and deacetylating tubulin, HDAC6 facilitates the transport of aggregates to the aggresome and their clearance by autophagy (PIMID:25429107, 22069321). HDAC6 interaction with ubiquitin and ISG15 was also shown to be important for viral infection as well as anti-viral defense. During the influenza A infection cycle, the virons fuse to late endosome membranes exposing a variety of unanchored ubiquitin moieties to the cytosol, attracting HDAC6 to the fusion site. HDAC6, in turn, binds to the capsid and links it to cytoskeleton motors dynein and myosin, generating a shearing force that disassembles the capsid allowing viral ribonucleoproteins to penetrate the cytosol (PIMID: 27783058). On the other hand, type I interferon pathway stimulation after viral infection leads to ISG15 expression and ISGylation of newly synthesized cellular and pathogenic proteins, which binds to HDAC6 leading to autophagic clearance (PIMID:25429107).</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Assay measuring the interaction of HDAC6 UBD with ubiquitin is based on NanoBRET technology &#8211; a proximity-based assay that can detect protein interactions by measuring energy transfer from a bioluminescent protein donor to a fluorescent protein acceptor. Initially, we determined the optimal donor to acceptor ratio of donor construct: N-terminally NanoLuc® tagged HDAC6 or UBD and acceptor construct: N-terminally HaloTag®Fusion tagged ubiquitin and ISG15. Due to a much higher background in  HDAC6/ubiquitin compared to HDAC6/ISG15 NanoBRET assay, possibly coming from protein polyubiquitination, the assay was initially optimized and validated based on HDAC6 and ISG15 interaction. After testing several cell lines and optimizing expression levels, the best results were obtained with MCF7 cells for UBD and with HEK293T for HDAC6. The assay was validated comparing the NanoBRET signal between wild type (WT) and ubiquitin/ISG15 binding deficient (R1155A, Y1184A) mutant (Mut) of HDAC6 and UBD. As shown in Fig 1. the NanoBRET ratios of ISG15 and Mut proteins were significantly lower compared to WT proteins. The assay was further validated with compound 135, the derivative of previously published UBD inhibitors (PIMID:29741882). Compound 135 antagonized HDAC6 and ubiquitin interaction <em>in vitro</em> with high potency (data not shown, Mandeep Mann) and decreased the NanoBRET ratio in a dose-dependent manner only in WT but not in Mut HDAC6 (Fig.2).</p>

<p><strong>Fig.2. Compound 135 decreased the interaction of wild type but not binding deficient mutant of full length HDAC6 or UBD with ISG15 in a dose-dependent manner. </strong>MCF7 or HEK293T cells were co-transfected with N-terminally NL- tagged wild type or R115A, Y1184A mutant UBD or HDAC6, respectively, and N-terminally HT- tagged ISG15. The cells were treated with indicated compound 135 concentrations for 20 h. <strong>A.</strong> Compound 135 inhibited HDAC6-UBD and ISG15 interaction with IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.1 µM. <strong>B</strong>. The compound135 inhibited HDAC6 and ISG15 interaction with IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.2 µM. Experimental triplicates of mean corrected NanoBRET ratios presented as % of DMSO control are indicated.<strong> NL</strong> – NanoLuc, <strong>HT</strong>&#8211; Halotag.</p>
<p>We also optimized and validated the assay measuring the interaction between HDAC6 and ubiquitin. The biggest challenge of the assay was the high background possibly coming from unspecific interaction due to polyubiquitination and aggregation. To prevent possible protein aggregation, we shorten the assay to 24 h format. The new format was also tested and is recommended for UBD/HDAC6 and ISG15 NanoBRET assay. As shown in Fig 3. the NanoBRET ratios between ubiquitin and Mut proteins were lower compared to WT proteins, however, the statistical difference was only observed for HDAC6-UBD, not full HDAC6. We also looked at the effect of compound 987, the more potent derivative of compound 135, on HDAC6 interaction with ubiquitin in NanoBRET assay. Compound 987 decreased the NanoBRET ratio in a dose-dependent manner only in WT but not in Mut HDAC6-UBD or HDAC6 (Fig.4).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My previous results showed that overexpression of HDAC11 decrease basal acetylation levels of exogenous histones as well as decrease the acetylation increase caused by histone acetyltransferases. In order to determine if the observed effect is caused by catalytic activity of HDAC11, I used catalytic HDAC11 mutants Y304H and H142,143A (PIMID: 30819897, 28927261) and published HDAC11 inhibitors SIS17, SIS7 (25 µM, PMID:31264832) and FT895 (5 µM, PMID: 29776742) for validation. I run the assay in different cell lines (HEK293T, Hela and MCF7) with various amounts of HDAC11 and HATs (GCN5, MYST3), various assay duration (1-2 days) and looked at the changes in H3KAc, H3K18Ac, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac levels by western blot.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The results are highly variable mostly due to low signal and effect of HDAC11 overexpression on cell growth (less cells).</li>
<li>In most conditions tested HDAC11 catalytic mutants showed similar decrease in acetylation compared to WT HDAC11.</li>
<li>None of the compounds inhibited the decreased acetylation caused by HDAC11 overexpression. Compound FT895 showed toxic effect even at 5 μM.</li>
<li>The results indicate that the decrease in histone acetylation levels caused by HDAC11 overexpression does not depend on HDAC11 catalytic activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the representative graph form one of the experiments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post I mentioned that there is controversy if HDAC11 can deacetylate histones. I decided to look at the effect of overexpression of HDAC11 on exogenous histone acetylation in cells. In my preliminary results I noticed that exogenous GFP-tagged histones, one day post transfection, have very low levels of acetylation; therefore I decided to add to the system some histone acetyltransferases (p300, GCN5, MYST1, PCAF). My results indicate that overexpression of HDAC11 decrease basal acetylation levels of exogenous histones as well as decrease the acetylation increase caused by histone acetyltransferases. Since we do not know if the observed effect is caused by catalytic activity of HDAC11, I generated catalytic HDAC11 mutants Y304H and H142,143A (previously published PMID:30819897, 28927261), which will be used for validation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>This is the first time I am going to share with you my research and I will start with the project I am currently working on, which is the development of cellular HDAC11 target engagement assay. HDAC11, the only member of class IV HDAC subfamily, was believed to be responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). However, recent <em>in vitro</em> data indicates that HDAC11 is 10,000 times more efficient in lysine defatty-acylation than deacetylation (Fig1).</p>
<p>Fig1.</p>

<p>Target engagement assays allow us to test if potential  inhibitors enter the cell and interact with a target protein. Here, we are interested in developing this type of assay for HDAC11. Recently, novel potent and cell active HDAC11 inhibitors have been developed, which can be used for cellular assay validation (FT895 and compound 14). (PMID: 29776742). The activity of inhibitors in cells were tested using NanoBRET<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Target Engagement  Assay, which measured the apparent affinity of test compounds by competitive displacement of proprietary compound labeled with a fluorescent tracer reversibly bound to  HDAC11 fused to Nanoluc luciferase. Currently we are in a process of development of our own fluorescent tracer based on published HDAC11 inhibitors and hopefully we will be able to use it for HDAC11 cellular assay development. However, since the tracer is not currently available I had to try other methods. One generic method for confirming target engagement is Cellular Thermal Stability Assays (CETSA) in which binding of the inhibitor increases the thermal stability of the target protein. I tested thermal stability of HDAC11 upon binding to published HDAC11 inhibitors using NanoLuc technology (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937980">29937980</a>). In the assay you are transfecting cells with protein fused to Nanloluc luciferease, treat with inhibitors and measure bioluminescent signal after heat denaturation. Compound binding to the protein should lead to protein stabilization compared to controls. The system can be used in cells, which are not permeabilized and permeabilized with digitonin as a control (Fig2).</p>

<p>In this experiment, I did not observe thermal stabilization of HDAC11-NanoLuc upon compounds FT895 (202) and 14 (201) treatment (Fig3). Experimental assay details are posted on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3267153#.XRyvVetKipo">Zenodo</a>.</p>

<p>Next I am going to test if I can detect any changes in histones acetylation upon HDAC11 overexpression and inhibitors treatment. I will also update you with my effort to develop assay based on two findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>HDAC11 suppresses the thermogenic program of adipose tissue (PMID: 30089714).</li>
<li>HDAC11 regulates the expression of intereukin 10 (PMID: 19011628).</li>
