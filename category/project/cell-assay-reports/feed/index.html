										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>PRDM9 (PR domain-containing protein 9) contains a subclass of the SET (PR/SET) domain that trimethylates histone 3 on lysine 4 and 36 (PIMID:24095733). It is expressed mainly in germ cells playing an important role in meiotic recombination (PIMID:27362481). Its aberrant expression has also been associated with genomic instability in cancer (PIMID:30341163).</p>
<p><strong>Assay Validation</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with previous findings, the overexpression of FLAG-tagged wild type PRDM9 but not its catalytic mutant (Y357A) led to an increase in histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation levels (H3K4me3) of exogenous (GFP-tagged) as well as endogenous histone H3 in cells (Fig.1). Due to high basal H3K4me3 levels, only a small increase in methylation was observed upon PRDM9 overexpression in endogenous H3, making the system with exogenous histone H3 preferential assay for compounds screening. The assay was additionally validated with PRDM9 selective inhibitor MRK-740 (PIMID:31848333). MRK-740 decreased PRDM9 dependent H3K4 trimethylation of exogenous histone H3 in a dose-dependent manner (PIMID:31848333, Fig.2). The assay z factor equals 0.83.</p>

<p>SMYD2 is protein-lysine N-methyltransferase that methylates both histones and non-histone proteins, including p53. It monomethylates K370 of p53 leading to decreased DNA-binding and consequently the lower transcriptional regulation activity of p53 (PIMID:17108971).</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation </strong></p>
<p>Based on the findings (PIMID:17108971), we developed SMYD2 cellular assay in which exogenous FLAG-tagged p53 is methylated by exogenous V5-tagged SMYD2. The assay was validated with two SMYD2 selective chemical probes: BAY-598 and PFI-5 (PIMID: 27075367, 31415173). Both compounds decreased monomethylation of exogenous p53-K370 in cells overexpressed with V5-SMYD2 (Fig.1,2). The z factor for the assay equals 0.87 (n=3).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>GID4 is the substrate-recognition subunit of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which has been shown to possess E3-ligase enzymatic activity (PIMID:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31885576">31885576</a>). GID4 was shown to bind proteins and peptides with a Pro/N-degron consisting of an unmodified N-terminal Pro and has the highest affinity for the peptide Pro-Gly-Leu-Trp (PIMID:29632410). In yeast Gid4 specifically targets the gluconeogenic enzymes (Fbp1, Icl1, and Mdh2) for proteasome-mediated degradation (PIMID: 31863529), however, substrate specificity for human GID4 has not been fully understood.</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>Cell-based thermal shift assays (CETSA) provide a native environment for measuring compounds’ target engagement and cell permeability. Standard western blot-based CETSA protocols are laborious, require high-quality antibodies to the target, and are generally not amenable to high-throughput compound screening. Therefore, we have adopted the HiBiT technology-based CETSA, which measures the thermal stability of a NanoLuc Luciferase fusion protein, to measure GID4 cellular target engagement in a 384-well plate format (Fig.1). The assay was validated with two compounds: 20964 and 12966, which showed significant dose-dependent stabilization of GID4 when tested <em>in vitro</em> by DSF. Using both compounds we observed reproducible stabilization of GID4 (Fig.2A) in cells. Since compound 20964 gave better T<sub>m</sub>-shift (∆T<sub>m</sub>), we tested if the stabilization is dose-dependent in a temperature range which gave the biggest difference between treated and untreated samples.  Compound 20964 showed the dose-dependent stabilization of GID4 (Fig.2B). The effect was significant at 1 µM concentration (Fig.2C). These results validate the utility of the HiBiT based CETSA assay to measure cellular target engagement of GID4.</p>

<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>PRMT3 was shown to asymmetrically dimethylate histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3) <em>in vitro </em>(PMID:22795084). Consistent with <em>in vitro </em>findings overexpression of wild type PRMT3 but not its catalytic mutant (E338Q) led to an increase in H4R3me2a (Fig.2). The assay was further validated with PRMT3 selective inhibitor SGC707, which decreased H4R3me2a levels in cells overexpressed with PRMT3 in a dose-dependant manner (Fig.3). The Z factor for the assay equals 0.59.</p>

<p>PRMT6 is type I protein arginine methyltransferase which mono- and asymmetrically dimethylates histone and nonhistone proteins, mainly in glycine and arginine rich motifs (Fig.1). PRMT6 shows predominant nuclear localization and is implicated in the regulation of nuclear processes such as DNA repair and gene expression (PIMID: 11724789, 18079182).</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Fig.1. </strong><strong>Mammalian PRMTs. </strong>There are 9 members and 3 types of the PRMT family. Type I, II and III PRMTs catalyze the formation of monomethyl arginines (Rme1). Type I PRMTs catalyze asymmetric arginine methylation (Rme2a), while type II PRMTs form symmetric arginine methylation (Rme2s). Type III PRMT can only monomethylate arginine residues. Modified from (PMID:29378138).</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>It has been reported that PRMT6 is the main contributor to histone H3 arginine 2 asymmetric dimethylation (H3R2me2a) in cells (PIMID: 17898714). We found that knocking down of PRMT6 for 3 days is not sufficient to observe a decent decrease in H3R2me2a levels, however, overexpression of wild type PRMT6 but not its catalytic mutant (V86K/D88A) led to increase in H3R2me2a levels (Fig.2). Overexpression of PRMT6 also increased H3 arginine 8 asymmetric dimethylation (H3R8me2a) and H4 arginine 3 asymmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2a) levels (Fig.2). The assay was further validated with PRMT Type I chemical probe (MS023). MS023 decreased PRMT6 dependent H3R2 asymmetric dimethylation in cells overexpressed with PRMT6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). The Z factor for the assay equals 0.63.</p>

<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>It has been reported that the RNA polymerase II mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) and BAF155, are PRMT4 substrates (PIMID: 26601288, 25927994). Consistently with previous findings, PRMT4 knock-down decreased asymmetric dimethylation of MED12 and BAF155 (Fig.2). The assay was validated with PRMT4 selective chemical probe TP-064 (PIMID: 29719619). TP-064 decreased PRMT4 asymmetric dimethylation of MED12 (Z factor = 0.6) and BAF155 (Z factor = 0.76) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>PRMT5 in complex with the WD-repeat protein MEP50 is the major type II protein arginine methyltransferase responsible for mono- and symmetric dimethylation of arginine in a great variety of proteins (Fig.1). It plays a critical role in diverse cellular processes such as genome organization, transcription, translation, differentiation, cell cycle, DNA repair,  RNA processing, and metabolism (PMID:25662273). PRMT5 expression levels and methyltransferase activity were found to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662273">25662273</a>).</p>

<p>It has been reported previously, that the various SMN complex proteins, including SmBB’ are PRMT5 substrates (PMID:19520849). We found that the knocking down of PRMT5, but not PRMT1, 3, 4, 6 and  7 resulted in decreased SmBB’ symmetric dimethylation levels (Fig.2). PRMT9, another type II PRMT, is also not affecting SmBB’ Rme2s levels (PIMID: 25737013). The assay was further validated by treatment with selective PRMT5 chemical probe, GSK591. GSK591 decreased SmBB’-Rme2s levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). The assay was also used to validate the cellular activity of another PRMT5 selective chemical probe LLY-283 (PMID:30034588).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The mammalian MYST1 is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases and is the primary enzyme that catalyzes the acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16). Acetylation of K16 is a prevalent mark associated with chromatin decondensation. MYST1 has been shown to play an essential role in embryonic formation and development, chromatin assembly, transcription activation, cellular apoptosis, double‐strand break repair, cellular stress response, and tumorigenesis (PMID:24452550, 26387537, 17967868, 24452485).</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>It was shown that MYST1 participates in at least two distinct multiprotein complexes (MSL and NSL) in human cells. Both complexes can acetylate H4K16; however, the NSL complex possesses broader substrate specificity and can also acetylate histone H4 at K5 and K8 (PMID:26784169).  Consistent with previous findings, the overexpression of MYST1 led to an increase in total lysine acetylation levels and acetylation of H4K16 on exogenous (GFP-tagged) as well as endogenous histone H4 (Fig.1 and 2). Due to high basal H4 acetylation levels, only a small increase in acetylation was observed upon MYST1 overexpression in endogenous H4 (Fig.2), making the system with exogenous histone H4 preferential assay for compounds screening. The assay was additionally validated with MYST1 catalytic mutant (K274R), which overexpression in contrast to WT MYST1 did not alter basal exogenous H4 acetylation levels (Fig1).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>PRMT1 is the type I protein arginine methyltransferase (Fig.1) which mono- and asymmetrically dimethylates histone and nonhistone proteins, mainly in glycine and arginine-rich motifs and is involved in various cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, DNA repair, cell cycle or signal transduction (PMID:26612103). It is responsible for depositing over 90% of the total asymmetric arginine dimethyl mark (PMID:23419748). It has been identified, that at least seven distinct PRMT1 isoforms are generated by complex alternative splicing in the 5’ region of its pre-mRNA, however, their exact role has not been fully understood (PMID:11448779, 11387442). Deregulated PRMT1 expression has been observed in a number of tumor types including brain, lung, breast, colon, bladder, and leukemia, which make it a potential target for anti-cancer therapy (PMID:23235912, 28061334).</p>

<p><strong>Fig.1. </strong><strong>Mammalian PRMTs. </strong>There are 9 members and 3 types of the PRMT family. Type I, II and III PRMTs catalyze the formation of monomethyl arginines (Rme1). Type I PRMTs catalyze asymmetric arginine methylation (Rme2a), while type II PRMTs form symmetric arginine methylation (Rme2s). Type III PRMT can only monomethylate arginine residues. Modified from (PMID:29378138).</p>
<p><strong>PRMT1 assay validation</strong></p>
<p>It has been reported that PRMT1 is the main contributor to H4R3 (histone 4 arginine 3) asymmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2a) in cells (PMID:17848568). Moreover, with the loss of PRMT1, a large number of substrates become targets for Type II and III PRMTs, because these substrates are presumably no longer blocked by Rme2a modification (PMID: 23419748). We found that knocking down of PRMT1, but not PRMT3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 decreased basal H4R3me2a levels and increased Rme1 and Rme2s levels in MCF7 cells (Fig.2). MCF7 cell line was chosen for the PRMT1 cellular assay due to the high basal levels of H4R3me2a (Fig.3). The assay was further validated with PRMT Type I chemical probe MS023 (PMID:26598975). MS023 decreased the levels of H4R3me2a in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The Z factor for the assay equals 0.83 (n=3).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to share with you the details for cellular assay detecting interaction between histone deacetylase HDAC6 and ubiquitin, which is a unique property within the histone deacetylase family.</p>
<p>HDAC6 is a member of the histone deacetylase family which deacetylate lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. It plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes such as cell signaling, autophagy, and trafficking (PIMID:30176876, 22069321). HDAC6 is composed of two catalytic domains as well as a unique zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). HDAC6 was shown to bind C-terminal RLRGG peptide present in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) via the UBD, which is an important step for misfolded proteins degradation (PIMID:29741882), autophagy, trafficking and other processes (PIMID:30176876, 22069321). By binding to polyubiquitinated or ISGylated protein aggregates and deacetylating tubulin, HDAC6 facilitates the transport of aggregates to the aggresome and their clearance by autophagy (PIMID:25429107, 22069321). HDAC6 interaction with ubiquitin and ISG15 was also shown to be important for viral infection as well as anti-viral defense. During the influenza A infection cycle, the virons fuse to late endosome membranes exposing a variety of unanchored ubiquitin moieties to the cytosol, attracting HDAC6 to the fusion site. HDAC6, in turn, binds to the capsid and links it to cytoskeleton motors dynein and myosin, generating a shearing force that disassembles the capsid allowing viral ribonucleoproteins to penetrate the cytosol (PIMID: 27783058). On the other hand, type I interferon pathway stimulation after viral infection leads to ISG15 expression and ISGylation of newly synthesized cellular and pathogenic proteins, which binds to HDAC6 leading to autophagic clearance (PIMID:25429107).</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Assay measuring the interaction of HDAC6 UBD with ubiquitin is based on NanoBRET technology &#8211; a proximity-based assay that can detect protein interactions by measuring energy transfer from a bioluminescent protein donor to a fluorescent protein acceptor. Initially, we determined the optimal donor to acceptor ratio of donor construct: N-terminally NanoLuc® tagged HDAC6 or UBD and acceptor construct: N-terminally HaloTag®Fusion tagged ubiquitin and ISG15. Due to a much higher background in  HDAC6/ubiquitin compared to HDAC6/ISG15 NanoBRET assay, possibly coming from protein polyubiquitination, the assay was initially optimized and validated based on HDAC6 and ISG15 interaction. After testing several cell lines and optimizing expression levels, the best results were obtained with MCF7 cells for UBD and with HEK293T for HDAC6. The assay was validated comparing the NanoBRET signal between wild type (WT) and ubiquitin/ISG15 binding deficient (R1155A, Y1184A) mutant (Mut) of HDAC6 and UBD. As shown in Fig 1. the NanoBRET ratios of ISG15 and Mut proteins were significantly lower compared to WT proteins. The assay was further validated with compound 135, the derivative of previously published UBD inhibitors (PIMID:29741882). Compound 135 antagonized HDAC6 and ubiquitin interaction <em>in vitro</em> with high potency (data not shown, Mandeep Mann) and decreased the NanoBRET ratio in a dose-dependent manner only in WT but not in Mut HDAC6 (Fig.2).</p>

<p><strong>Fig.2. Compound 135 decreased the interaction of wild type but not binding deficient mutant of full length HDAC6 or UBD with ISG15 in a dose-dependent manner. </strong>MCF7 or HEK293T cells were co-transfected with N-terminally NL- tagged wild type or R115A, Y1184A mutant UBD or HDAC6, respectively, and N-terminally HT- tagged ISG15. The cells were treated with indicated compound 135 concentrations for 20 h. <strong>A.</strong> Compound 135 inhibited HDAC6-UBD and ISG15 interaction with IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.1 µM. <strong>B</strong>. The compound135 inhibited HDAC6 and ISG15 interaction with IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.2 µM. Experimental triplicates of mean corrected NanoBRET ratios presented as % of DMSO control are indicated.<strong> NL</strong> – NanoLuc, <strong>HT</strong>&#8211; Halotag.</p>
<p>We also optimized and validated the assay measuring the interaction between HDAC6 and ubiquitin. The biggest challenge of the assay was the high background possibly coming from unspecific interaction due to polyubiquitination and aggregation. To prevent possible protein aggregation, we shorten the assay to 24 h format. The new format was also tested and is recommended for UBD/HDAC6 and ISG15 NanoBRET assay. As shown in Fig 3. the NanoBRET ratios between ubiquitin and Mut proteins were lower compared to WT proteins, however, the statistical difference was only observed for HDAC6-UBD, not full HDAC6. We also looked at the effect of compound 987, the more potent derivative of compound 135, on HDAC6 interaction with ubiquitin in NanoBRET assay. Compound 987 decreased the NanoBRET ratio in a dose-dependent manner only in WT but not in Mut HDAC6-UBD or HDAC6 (Fig.4).</p>
