										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Grin1 </em></strong><strong>p.Tyr647Ser Project</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background. </strong><em>Grin </em>genes across species encode for proteins that make up the different NMDA receptor subunits. <em>GRIN1 </em>mutations (usually heterozygous) are associated with intellectual disability with epilepsy in humans, including the rare p.Tyr647Ser (Y647S) variant. This missense mutation occurs in the M3 helix of the transmembrane domain of <em>GRIN1 </em>which, importantly, is conserved between human <em>GRIN1 </em>and mouse <em>Grin1</em>. Currently, no effective pharmacological intervention or gene therapy exists to treat human patients with <em>GRIN1 </em>disorders. Patients with different variants to the <em>GRIN1</em>gene vary widely in symptom presentation. Thus, it is imperative to independently study each of the variants preclinically when developing treatments.</p>
<p>To do this, we generated <em>Grin1<sup>Y647S </sup></em>mice using CRISPR and bred founder mice to develop F1  <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>progeny. As proof-of-concept for our study, our first aim is to evaluate the behaviour of <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>mice to ascertain whether there is phenotypic similarity to <em>GRIN1 </em>Y647S patients.</p>
<p>This entry describes <strong>pilot results </strong>from the Ramsey Laboratory regarding behavioural consequences of heterozygous Y647S mutation in mice.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioural Assays, Results, and Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>Each graph contains data from <em>n</em>= 4 WT and <em>n =</em>4 <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>mice of &gt;12 weeks of age mixed sexes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Field Test</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To measure locomotor activity.</em>Mice were placed in plexiglass arenas of 20x20x45 cm and their locomotor activity was measured using digital activity monitoring of infrared light beam breaks for 2h in 5min bins:</p>
<p><strong>This data has been removed in anticipation of a research grant outcome. Please email k.intson@utoronto.ca if you are interested in hearing about progress on this project. </strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Social Affiliative Assay</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To measure social behaviour. </em>Mice were placed in an opaque open-top arena of 62x42x22 cm containing two wire cups. One wire cup contained a novel, same-age, same-sex mouse as a social stimulus, while the other cup was empty. Mice were allowed to freely explore the arena for 8min and their activity was measured using video recording motion software. The time spent in the 3cm zone surrounding each cup was recorded, as well as the track length each mouse accumulated around each cup, and the number of visits they made to each cup.</p>
<p><strong>This data has been removed in anticipation of a research grant outcome. Please email k.intson@utoronto.ca if you are interested in hearing about progress on this project. </strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Elevated Plus Maze</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To measure anxiety-like behaviour.</em>Mice were placed in a elevated maze (39 cm high) composed of two opposing open arms (30.5&#215;5 cm) and two opposing closed arms (30.5x5x15.2 cm). Mice were placed in an open arm of the maze and allowed to freely explore for 8 min in dim light while being recorded. Motion tracking software measured the amount of time spent in open and closed arms.</p>
<p><strong>This data has been removed in anticipation of a research grant outcome. Please email k.intson@utoronto.ca if you are interested in hearing about progress on this project. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Other observations.</strong> I report that 1 male and 1 female <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>mouse each displayed a seizure when placed on the elevated plus maze. I would describe this seizure as atonic-like in nature: while mice stood on their hind legs, I observed rapid chewing movements, light convusions, and they fell to the floor of the EPM. Seizures lasted ~10s and mice rapidly regained consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Planned experiments. </strong>Future experiments will involve boosting behaviour experimental group numbers, and examining biochemical consequences of Y647S on overall NMDA receptor function in order to determine treatment strategies for <em>GRIN1</em>patients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the Ramsey Lab, this project began in 2018, when we were invited to a parent-organized meeting for caregivers of GRIN1 patients. Our group uses mice to study the NMDA receptor (which is encoded by the GRIN genes) in the context of schizophrenia and autism. It was only in 2018 that we learned of a rare disease caused by de novo mutations in the GRIN1 gene. Then we learned that single base pair mutations have been discovered in all of the seven GRIN genes that encode NMDA receptors. We have since moved our research focus towards helping GRIN patients, and have joined the growing community of scientists and clinicians with this same goal.</p>
<p>What are the features of GRIN disorders? All patients have some level of intellectual disability, but other features of the syndrome are variable, depending on the individual patient and the nature of their specific variant. Many children have low muscle tone that leads to developmental delays in motor skills and difficulties feeding. Many children have seizures that vary in severity from brief and infrequent to life-threatening. Other common symptoms include reduced or absent speech, cortical visual impairment, hyperactive and repetitive movements, and sleep disturbances. In talking with caregivers, it seems clear that these symptoms are the ones where therapeutic interventions could greatly improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>It is an enormous task to care for and raise a child with such special needs. However, the GRIN parents have found each other through online support groups. They are providing helpful information about medicines and about the occupational therapy that enables GRIN patients to gain motor skills. They have also started foundations to help other parents and caregivers, or to provide financial support for research.</p>
<p>The support network that GRIN parents have developed should set the example for GRIN researchers. It is our hope that the cooperation of parents to share information and advance medical care will inspire scientists to build an open science community. If you would like to join the GRIN disorder open science platform to share your research, please email me at a.ramsey@utoronto.ca.</p>
