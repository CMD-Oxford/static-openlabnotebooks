										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>NSD3 is a member of the NSD (nuclear receptor SET domain- containing) family of H3K36 methyltransferases. It has two isoforms: long -1437 amino acid and short &#8211; 645 amino acids, which are derived from alternative splicing of exon 10.  In contrast to long isoform, the short isoform lacks the methyltransferase domain and it contains only one histone methyl-lysine reader domain (PWWP1).  The overexpression of both NSD3 isoforms is capable of oncogenic transformation indicating that the oncogenic function is not related to methyltransferase activity. Short NSD3 isoform was shown to sustain AML leukemia by linking BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler, through the PWWP chromatin reader domain.  (PMID: 20940404, 23269674, 25942451, 26626481)</p>
<p><strong>Assay validation</strong></p>
<p>Assay measuring the interaction of NSD3-PWWP1 to histone H3 was developed using NanoBRET technology &#8211; a proximity-based assay that can detect protein interactions by measuring energy transfer from a bioluminescent protein donor to a fluorescent protein acceptor. The assay was optimized and validated using NSD3 and H3 antagonist BI-9466 and W284/E318K binding deficient mutant. The best results were obtained with U2Os cells transfected with C-terminally NanoLuc tagged NSD3-PWWP1 and H3 at 1:10 ratio. As shown in Fig 1. chemical probe antagonist (BI-9466) but not its negative control (BI-9321) selectively decreased the BRET signal only in WT NSD3-PWWP1. No effect was observed on binding deficient W284A/E318K mutant and closely related NSD2-PWWP1 domain. BI-9466 decreased NSD3-PWWP1 and H3 interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig2). (PIMID: 31285596)</p>

Next, I was interested in using the isoform-level expression data from <a href="http://firebrowse.org/">Firebrowse</a> to look at how different isoforms may be regulated. Is expression correlated or are there more complex regulatory mechanisms that control splicing decisions?</p>

<p>Firstly, I found that the short isoform is expressed roughly 10-fold over long isoforms, making it the dominant isoform in the LUSC data (Figure 1 &#8211; B).  Next, when comparing transcript levels of long vs short, I observed a significant moderately positive correlation, suggesting that the isoforms are likely co-regulated. I hope the analysis will be helpful in framing the shared and separate functions of the two isoforms uncovered in future experiments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days CRISPR gene editing needs little introduction. From humble origins as a bacterial defence system evolved to thwart viral invaders, CRISPR-based technologies have recently made headlines for their promise to revolutionize medicine. While there is a lot of excitement surrounding the use of gene editing in the clinic, it is also an incredibly valuable tool for studying the function of proteins in cells. For my project, I will be using CRISPR to make genetic changes to the NSD3 gene and study the outcome, beginning first by using the technology to create NSD3 knock out cell lines.</p>
<p>There is an ever-expanding catalogue of CRISPR reagents available to scientists. I&#8217;ve decided to use a method that involves the in vitro (in a tube) assembly of ribonucleoproteins (in this case Cas9 + annealed tracrRNA:crRNA &#8211; RNPs), which can then be introduced into a cell via lipofection or electroporation. Using RNPs as opposed to viral delivery or plasmid-based transfections is advantageous as the expression of Cas9 is transient limiting off-target effects and it is compatible with many different cell types.</p>
<p>Using this approach, the first step would be to either buy or purify recombinant Cas9. Since I work at the SGC, where expertise in protein production is abundant, I opted to purify recombinant Cas9 using Jennifer Doudna&#8217;s expression plasmid from AddGene (<a href="https://www.addgene.org/69090/"># 69090</a>). With help from Rachel Harding and Mani Ravichandran, I was able to make highly pure, low-endotoxin, active Cas9 protein for my future editing experiments (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1325937#.W2I2FtJKjb0">see extended details of the protein prep &amp; QC on </a>zenodo). Next steps &#8211; getting the RNPs into cells, testing for INDELs at the cut site, and screening clones for NSD3 disruption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NSD3 is located on a region of chromosome 8 (8p11-12) that is frequently amplified in several forms of cancer. It has been suggested that NSD3 (WHSC1L1) may be a driver of tumorigenesis in this context (Mahmood et al. 2013). However, it is still unclear how amplification of NSD3 contributes to the disease and whether or not it is a good candidate for targeted therapy.</p>
<p>Given the phenotypes I have observed in lung cancer models, I was interested in using publically available lung cancer patient data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to try exploring this question.</p>
<p>In an earlier analysis (full details + code <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1219208#.W1IP_tJKjb0">here</a>), I found that amplification of NSD3 was more commonly associated with squamous cell cancer than adenocarcinoma (Figure 1a). Next, looking at gene expression data, I found that amplification of NSD3 leads to increased expression levels, supporting the possibility of NSD3-driven downstream events in the context of 8p11-12 amplifications. I also looked at patient survival as well as mutational profiles of these tumours, finding no significant difference compared to patients that do not have an 8p11-12 amplification (Figure 1d-e).</p>

Analysis of NSD3 Amplification in Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) TCGA Datasets (a) Expression level (RSEM) of NSD3 in normal versus tumour samples (b) Histogram of NSD3 copy-number status. A value greater than 2 indicates high-level confidence that the gene is amplified. (c) NSD3 expression levels (RSEM) in amplified versus non-amplified samples. (d) Survival curve of patients with an NSD3 amplification compared to non-amplified. (e) Mutational profiles of TCGA-LUSC patients stratified by NSD3 amplification status.</p></div>
<p>Next, I was interested in how NSD3 amplification may influence gene expression patterns and whether this may reveal a potential susceptibility of 8p11-12 amplified cancers ( See full detail &amp; code on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1318236#.W1IQbtJKjb0">Zenodo</a>). After performing differential expression analysis of amplified vs non-amplified TCGA-LUSC RNA-Seq data, I found that many of the upregulated genes were associated with the 8p11-12 amplicon (Figure 2). There are a number of genes encoded in this region, including chromatin modifiers and assumed oncogenes. Therefore, it is difficult to untangle NSD3-dependent changes in gene expression versus those that may be driven by other gene products originating from this region.</p>

<p>To focus in on NSD3-associated gene expression profiles, I next took the samples with the highest NSD3 expression (top 20%) and performed differential expression analysis against those with the lowest NSD3 expression (bottom 20%) (Figure 3). Here, I identified significantly more differentially expressed genes than when comparing amplified to non-amplified samples (Figure 4b). I&#8217;ve included an interactive plot and table with the results below. Feel free to explore the data, and please let me know if you see something interesting/informative.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had time yet to explore this analysis in significant depth. What I have found is that genes that were upregulated in the high NSD3 expressing samples showed enrichment in hedgehog signalling genes and targets of E2F transcription factor. Surprisingly, downregulated genes were actually enriched in EMT factors. This observation is in disagreement with my hypothesis that NSD3 promotes EMT. At this point is difficult to interpret the significance of these transcriptional changes and how they may relate to what I&#8217;ve seen in my experiments, lots more research and experiments are needed before drawing any solid conclusions from this analysis. It will be helpful to keep this data in mind and revisit it as I move the project forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To understand what proteins do, scientists often test the consequence their absence has on a cell. A common method uses a cells regulatory machinery to disrupt gene expression with complementary RNA molecules, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference">RNA interference</a>. Here I used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to deplete NSD3 and test the effect this has on epithelial cell identity in a lung cancer model. Importantly, siRNA molecules can be designed to target specific isoforms of NSD3, allowing us to test their individual functions (Figure 1 &#8211; Isoforms of NSD3).</p>

Gene-level depiction of known NSD3 isoforms.</p></div>
<p>I first tested several different concentrations of siRNA on H1299 cells and determined the degree of NSD3 loss by western blotting (Figure 2). Surprisingly, I observed depletion of NSD3 with only one of two antibodies tested (Figure 2, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1219201">full experimental details</a>). This suggests abcam&#8217;s NSD3 antibody (<a href="http://www.abcam.com/nsd3-antibody-epr13813-n-terminal-ab180500.html">ab180500</a>), which was advertised as knock-out validated, likely recognizes a completely different protein. Additionally, ab180500 did not recognize NSD3-Short, even though the epitope is present in the short isoform. This experiment shows how important it is to validate antibodies and that this reagent should not be used to study NSD3.</p>

<p>Next, I looked at E-cadherin expression as a marker of an epithelial cell state (Figure 3, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1263398">full experimental details</a>).  With siRNA that target both long and short isoforms, I observed an increase in E-cadherin when NSD3 was depleted. <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/following-up-on-nsd3s-involvement-in-epithelial-to-mesenchymal-reprogramming/">Previously</a> I showed overexpression of NSD3 decreased E-cadherin, together these results suggest the amount of NSD3 present in a cell influences the transcriptional programs that control cell identity. To test if this function is isoform specific, I used siRNA molecules that target either the long or short isoforms of NSD3 (Figure 4, full experimental details &#8211; <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1258215">A</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1258223">B</a>). I found that knockdown of the short isoform and not the long increased E-cadherin expression levels and reduced cell migration. As the catalytic SET domain is absent in NSD3-short, NSD3&#8217;s H3K36me methyltransferase activity does not appear to be required for this function. Importantly, this supports the idea that NSD3-Short is an important mediator of cell identity and, in the context of cancer promotes, metastatic properties.</p>

NSD3 Status Across Multiple Cancer Types (Data from cBioPortal)</p></div>
<p>To follow up on this putative phenotype, I have tested the same cell lines for <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1226772#.Wt0MI4jwbb0">E-cadherin expression</a> and in <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1226774#.Wt0OFYjwbb0">wound healing assays</a> (Figure 2 &#8211; full experimental details and results in the links). During epithelial to mesenchymal transitioning (EMT), transcription networks become activated and cytoskeletal rearrangements take place, promoting migratory capacity and invasiveness. Cadherins are a family of cell adhesion molecules that are important regulators of these events. In particular, E-cadherin, a marker for polarized epithelial cells, is downregulated during EMT. When we assay E-cadherin levels in the H1299 cell lines, we observe decreased expression with either wild-type or PWWP1 mutant (W284A) NSD3 transgene overexpression (Figure 2A). Next, to test if these cells display increased migratory capacity, I turned to a field standard, the wound healing assay. This involves making a scratch in a cell monolayer and measuring the extent to which cells migrate and divide into the cleared space over time. We observe that these cell lines appear to close wounds faster than the control (Empty Vector). Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that NSD3short is a potentiator of EMT, although PWWP1 function does not appear to be required. These results will be validated by repeating with independently transduced and puro-selected stable lines and in NSD3-knockdown conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a study of cancer-focused protein-protein interactions identified a direct interaction between NSD3 and the oncoprotein Myc in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1299 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5316855/">(Li, Z et al. 2017)</a>.  Importantly, the study found that increased NSD3 expression levels can activate Myc in H1299 cells as measured by an E-box luciferase reporter. However, the functional significance of this activity in the context of lung cancer remains unclear.</p>
<p>To study NSD3 in this context, as well as other cell types, I have been optimizing lentiviral vectors to express a tagged NSD3short transgene. Initially, I had <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/western-blots-lentiviruses-building-tools-to-study-nsd3/">limited success</a> producing viral particles capable of integrating a bicistronic expression cassette containing NSD3short and a puromycin resistance marker separated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). I hypothesized that this may be due to packaging constraints of the lentiviral system and opted to decrease the size of my construct by replacing the IRES element with a sequence encoding a T2A self-cleaving peptide (details of mutagenesis can be found here &#8211; <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1170478#.WqkjKejwbSE">Zenodo &#8211; Exp016</a>). The 2A self-cleaving system has the added benefit of equimolar expression, while the IRES sequence tends to favour expression of the first coding sequence at approximately 3:1 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22114669">(Goedhart et al. 2011)</a>. For a helpful overview of this topic, I suggest checking out an excellent<a href="http://blog.addgene.org/plasmids-101-multicistronic-vectors"> blog post</a> on the subject over at addgene. This modification to the initial construct improved production of functional virus, as I was able to select for stable integration and expression of NSD3short in multiple cells lines (full experimental details can be found here &#8211; <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1197974#.WqkjW-jwbSE">Zenodo &#8211; Exp018</a>). Interestingly, overexpression of either NSD3short or a PWWP1 mutant (W284A) deficient in H3K36me2 binding resulted in altered morphological features in H1299 cells (Figure1). In cells overexpressing NSD3short, I observed greater eccentricities in their appearance with some cells displaying long projections. This may be indicative of an<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial%E2%80%93mesenchymal_transition"> </a>epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial%E2%80%93mesenchymal_transition">EMT</a>), which would be in line with elevated Myc activity (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144848">Cho, KB et al. 2010</a>). EMT is a developmental switch that can promote invasion and migration of cancer cells, phenotypes associated with metastasis.  However, before we can make any claim with respect to NSD3&#8217;s involvement in this process, I will have to follow up these observations by assaying hallmarks of EMT, like downregulation of E-cadherin, with multiple biological replicates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The early stages of a project often involve spending considerable time building tools to effectively tackle the problem. In cell biology, this often includes testing antibodies and expression constructs in your cell lines of interest. Putting in the work to properly validate these reagents early on in a study is critical. Poorly validated antibodies are, at least partially, to blame for <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-crisis-blame-it-on-the-antibodies-1.17586">poor reproducibility</a> in life sciences. Recently, I tested two additional commercial antibodies to NSD3, which displayed quite a bit of cross-reactivity in western blotting (full experimental details are up on zenodo<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1170474#.WoHSbyXwbIU"> &#8211; exp012</a>). To date, the AbCam (a180500) antibody seems to perform best in my hands.</p>
<p>To express 3xFLAG tagged NSD3 short in different cell backgrounds, I have been working with a lentivirus expression system. Recently, I have made a W284A mutant NSD3-short expression plasmid to test PWWP1-dependent phenotypes (see zenodo &#8211; <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1170478#.WoHS_SXwbIU">exp 013</a>). NSD3&#8217;s PWWP1 domain recognizes and binds H3K36me2 methylated histones, and it is still unclear how this module contributes to NSD3&#8217;s role in oncogenesis. Also, I have tested lentivirus generated from the RRL-NSD3short-IRES-Puro plasmid, in H1299 cells, a lung cancer model. Unfortunately, this construct did not generate infectious particles relative to empty-vector or GFP positive control (see zenodo &#8211; <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1170482#.WoHTwiXwbIU">exp014</a>). I believe this may be due to the inherent packaging limits of the virus I am using ~10 000kb. My current expression vector exceeds this by about 500 bp, which may be inhibiting viral production. I should be able to reduce the size under this threshold by swapping out the IRES bicistronic element and replacing it with a P2A self-cleaving peptide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to study NSD3 in the context of acute myeloid leukemia, I first need to determine the best reagents/tools. This includes characterizing model cell lines as well as antibodies that can be used for future experiments. Here I looked at the expression of NSD3 by western blotting in three AML cell lines using a rabbit monoclonal antibody from AbCam (<a href="http://www.abcam.com/nsd3-antibody-epr13813-n-terminal-ab180500.html">ab180500</a>). It appears there may be some protein degradation in two of three samples (MOLM-13 and HL-60). I will be testing another antibody this week and additional cell lines.</p>
