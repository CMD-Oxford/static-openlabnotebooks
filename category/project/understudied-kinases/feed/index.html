				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further down the line I want to be able to test the activation of the BMP signalling pathway downstream of the ALK2 receptor. For this I plan to use the alkaline phosphatase gene as a readout &#8211; it&#8217;s a well known gene activated downstream of BMP signalling so a lot of easy to use assays already exist for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/optimising-an-assay-to-detect-alkaline-phosphatase-activity-in-c2c12-cells/">when I tested this assay with the standard C2C12 cell line it didn&#8217;t work particularly well</a> so I&#8217;ve decided to try again with a new set of cells. This time I&#8217;m choosing connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) from FOP patients as a reporter cell line because they respond more strongly to the signals that activate the BMP pathway (called BMP ligands).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never worked with these cells before so, again, I needed to work out how many I&#8217;ll need to get a good result from the assay. These cells however grow as a very thin sheet which is so see-through that I initially couldn&#8217;t tell if the wells were full. To solve this I used stains called Calcein AM and Hoechst. Calcein AM can stain any living cell because they metabolise it from a see-through molecule into a fluorescent green product, whereas Hoechst can stick to DNA and turn all the cell nuclei blue, and so suddenly, all of my cells glow:</p>
<div id="attachment_2389" style="width: 1382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png"><img class="wp-image-2389 size-full" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png" alt="Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)" width="1372" height="784" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example.png 1372w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-300x171.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-768x439.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calcein-AM-example-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fibroblast cells stained with Calcein AM (green) and Hoechst (blue)</p></div>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they pretty?</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re this easy to see, it&#8217;s even easier to see how many cells are needed to fill a well, but not get overcrowded. You can read more about how I did that in my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2546911">Zenodo post</a>.</p>
<p>The only question I have left is why some cells didn&#8217;t stain with Calcein AM, even though their nucleus looks fine? Anyone know the answer?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">At SGC we are interested in developing protein kinase inhibitors with a high selectivity towards other protein kinases. Based on lead compounds from the literature and our group new and selective CDKL2 inhibitors should be designed, synthesized and tested. Carla Alamillo, a former member of our group, worked on this topic and mentioned in her last entry in the open notebook about this topic  (<a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/sns-032-analogues-update/">https://openlabnotebooks.org/sns-032-analogues-update/</a>) the pro-mising role of SNS-032 as a starting point for new protein kinase inhibitors (Figure 1).<br />
SNS-032 shows a low K<sub>d</sub>value for CDKL2 (48 nM) but also for many other kinases. This means the selectivity of this compound towards other protein kinases is low. In contrast, CAF-181 synthesized by Carla (compound 11 in Carla’s entry) shows low K<sub>d</sub>values for CDKL2 and CDK7 and a high selectivity towards the other kinases tested. Additionally, CAF-181 reveals a moderate CDKL2 IC<sub>50</sub>value of 417 nM. Therefore, CAF-181 represents a good lead compound for the development of new CDKL2 inhibitors with improved selectivity towards CDK7.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-2327 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture1-1-300x174.png" alt="" width="694" height="402" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture1-1-300x174.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture1-1.png 668w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Figure 1. </strong>Lead compounds SNS-032 and CAF-181 and their respective K<sub>d </sub>values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To design new compounds the molecular modeling software Flare<sup>TM</sup>(Cresset<sup>®</sup>) was used. The first step for the <em>in silico </em>docking is the selection of the crystal structure of the respective protein. Two crystal structures of CDKL2 are available on the PDB website (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org</a>) but not published in a journal yet. One crystal structure is co-crystallized with the compound TCS 2312 (PDB-ID 4BBM) and the other with the compound DKI (PDB-ID 4AAA) (Figure 2). The 2D interaction maps (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4AAA">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4AAA</a> and <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4BBM">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4BBM</a>) have to be flipped vertically to match the same amino acid residues. Interestingly, Val83 (Figure 2, blue box) seems to be an impor-tant interaction partner for the ligands since both compounds reveal two H-bond interactions with Val83.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-2328 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture2-300x181.png" alt="" width="629" height="380" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture2-300x181.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture2.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Figure 2. </strong>Crystal structures of CDKL2: co-crystallized with TCS 2312 (A, PDB-ID 4BBM, DOI: 10.2210/pdb4BBM/pdb) and co-crystallized with DKI (B, PDB-ID 4AAA, DOI: 10.2210/pdb4AAA/pdb). Black dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and metal interactions. Green solid lines show hydrophobic interactions and green dashed lines show π-π and π-cation interactions (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4BBM">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4BBM</a> and <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4AAA">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4AAA</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the <em>in silico </em>docking studies the crystal structure 4BBM was used because the structure 4AAA reveals an unresolved amino acid sequence ending with Ala148 and NME148A (Figure 3B, black box). Unfortunately, this sequence part also contains the amino acid Phe147 that forms a part of the active site and likely interacts with inhibitors. However, the protein structure used for the docking should contain a fully resolved amino acid sequence in this area. The protein structure 4BBM provides a fully resolved amino acid sequence which makes it suitable for <em>in silico </em>docking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-2329 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture3-300x81.png" alt="" width="870" height="235" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture3-300x81.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture3-768x208.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture3.png 974w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Figure 3. </strong>Structure of CDKL2 co-crystallized with either TCS 2312 (orange, A, PDB-ID 4BBM) or DKI (dark red, B, PDB-ID 4AAA). The dashed green and orange lines indicate H-bond interactions and the purple lines CH-π interactions. Docked ligands are shown as sticks. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are colored in red and blue, respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, Phe147 in structure 4BBM is not clarified. Instead of the phenyl ring a methyl group is visible. Capping by the docking program Flare<sup>TM</sup> did not result in phenylalanine but just in a partially aromatic phenyl ring of this amino acid (Figure 3A, black box). This problem was solved by mutation of this position into a phenylalanine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To investigate the selectivity of newly designed compounds they should also be investigated during the <em>in silico </em>docking into the crystal structure of CDK7 with the PDB-ID 1UA2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next step of <em>in silico</em> docking into the CDKL2 structure 4BBM included the validation of the crystal structure and the docking protocol. After preparation and minimization of the crystal structure the co-crystallized ligand TCS 2312 should be redocked into the active site. However, the co-crystallized ligand TCS 2312 shows different bond orders/tautomeric states as well as a different protonation state on the basic nitrogen than the literature compound TCS 2312. To calculate the RMSD value between the binding mode of the structurally corrected and redocked TCS 2312 and the co-crystallized ligand the co-crystallized binding mode had to be corrected because Flare<sup>TM</sup> can only calculate a RMSD value between structurally identical compounds. Therefore, the co-crystallized ligand was corrected and only the resorcinol moiety was minimized to achieve a planar aromatic system. In this way the binding mode of the co-crystallized ligand was changed as little as possible. Then, the corrected, co-crystallized ligand TCS  2312 was minimized and the structure at physiological pH was generated. Afterwards, this compound was docked into the crystal structure 4BBM. Figure 4A shows the similar orientation of corrected, co-crystallized TCS 2312 (yellow) and the redocked ligand (purple). The similar orientation of both binding modes and the hereby resulting low RMSD value<br />
(1.65 Å) suggest that the corrected CDKL2 protein crystal structure 4BBM and the docking protocol are suitable for the <em>in silico </em>docking of new compounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-2330 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture4-300x181.png" alt="" width="762" height="460" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture4-300x181.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture4-768x463.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture4.png 943w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Figure 4. </strong>Predicted binding modes of TCS 2312 (A, purple), CAF-181 (B) and SNS-032 (C and D) obtained by docking into the CDKL2 crystal structure with the PDB-ID 4BBM.Binding mode of the corrected, co-crystallized ligand TCS 2312 (A, yellow). The dashed green and orange lines indicate H-bond interactions and the purple lines CH-π interactions. Docked ligands are shown as sticks. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are colored in red and blue, respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Figures 4B-D the docking results of CAF-181 and SNS-032 are shown. The <em>tert</em>-butyl group of both compounds occupies the inner part of the active site whereas the piperazine ring of CAF-181 and the piperidine of SNS 032 point towards the solvent accessible area. The N-atom of the SNS-032 piperidine ring is part of an H-bond interaction with one of the carboxylic acid moieties of either Glu130 (C) or Asp89 (D). Therefore, it might be promising to introduce amide substituents that can interact with those acidic amino acids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CAF compounds, synthesized and tested previously in our group, were docked into the CDKL2 crystal structure 4BBM and in the CDK7 crystal structure 1UA2. The respective docking scores and electrostatic complementarity<sup>TM </sup>scores of the resulting docking poses reveal a good correlation to the K<sub>d </sub>values of those compounds regarding CDKL2. However, no clear correlation was found regarding docking of CAF compounds in CDK7. This observation could be explained with the larger active site of CDK7 and its many solvent accessible areas that could facilitate binding of structurally diverse compounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, <em>in silico</em> docking of SNS-032 and CAF-181 in the active site of CDK7 reveal  curved orientations of both compounds (Figure 5). The green color of the electrostatic complementarity<sup>TM </sup>surface of the SNS-032 binding mode in Figure 5C indicates a high electrostatic complementarity<sup>TM </sup>of the ligand to this active site which could be the reason for the high inhibitory activity of SNS-032 regarding CDK7.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><img class="wp-image-2331 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture5-300x180.png" alt="" width="751" height="451" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture5-300x180.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture5-768x461.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/122018_Picture5.png 962w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Figure 5. </strong>Predicted binding modes obtained by docking into the CDK7 crystal structure with the PDB-ID 1UA2:<br />
(A) SNS-032. (B) SNS-032 with the electrostatic potential surface of CDK7. (C) SNS-032 with its electrostatic complementarity<sup>TM </sup>surface. (D) CAF-181. The dashed green and orange lines indicate H-bond interactions and the purple lines CH-π interactions. Docked ligands are shown as sticks. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are colored in red and blue, respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on this observation new CDKL2 inhibitors should reveal restrained flexibility to avoid the curved orientation in CDK7 and thereby increase the selectivity towards CDK7. Among others this could be achieved by replacement of the flexible thio-methylene linker by a more rigid linker. In my next entry I will show the docking results of more rigid compounds obtained by both <em>in silico </em>docking into the crystal structure of CDKL2 and CDK7.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please feel free to suggest other ideas for CDKL2 inhibitors with increased selectivity towards CDK7. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the line of delivering a chemical probe for DRAK2/STK17B kinase, we decided to revise the procedure to synthesize analogs with a thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine core, which are intended to be used as negative control in our DRAK2 inhibition study.</p>
<p>We shortened the synthesis of these pyrimidines to 2 steps from the starting material 6-bromo-4-chlorothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine <strong>1</strong> and mercaptoacetic acid <strong>2</strong>, Figure 1.  Here, we eliminated a previous step involving the saponification of an ester moiety to get to the carboxylic acid <strong>3</strong>, which is obtained in quantitative yield and easily purified by rinsing with water.</p>
<p>Using this shorter route, we prepared a few analogs <strong>AP-90, AP-94, AP-262-264</strong>, which were recently screened as DRAK2 inhibitors, showing all of them cell potency &gt;10,000 nM; in other words, they are inactive against DRAK2 and because of their structural similarity with the active compounds in this series, they can be used as negative control for future experiments and probe development.</p>

<p>These are all compounds that <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/category/scientist/jong-fu-wong/">Jong Fu</a> has already tested with his assays so we know they effectively inhibit ACVR1, but I thought it would be a good idea to try them out on my DIPG cells and see how well they can kill them. I included a few different variables in this screen to test what could make a difference to the outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tested cells grown in 2D and 3D because this has been noted to change the outcome of compound screens in other systems</li>
<li>I tested the compounds alone, or in addition to radiation in order to test whether the compounds were effective in addition to current DIPG treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested how effective each compound is by growing cells for 7 days in the presence of the compound. At the end I measured how alive or healthy the cells were (i.e. their viability) by using a pre-developed kit that measures the amount of ATP inside the cell by using an enzyme that can produce light when ATP is present. ATP is measured because this is sometimes called the &#8216;energy currency of the cell&#8217; so living cells have to have ATP inside them, whereas dead cells won&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be counted.</p>
<p>This screen produced a lot of data at once which is best visualised as heatmaps like these:</p>
<div id="attachment_2227" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2227" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png" alt="" width="780" height="929" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-860x1024.png 860w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-252x300.png 252w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ALK2i-figure-heatmap-768x914.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ACVR1 inhibitor M4K2009 is best at reducing mutant ACVR1 DIPG cell viability, but is not effective in ACVR1 wild-type cells</strong><br />Heatmaps showing the viability (relative to an untreated control) of a 2D culture of mutant ACVR1 DIPG cells (A) or wild-type ACVR1 DIPG cells (B) following 7 days in the presence of 1μM of the indicated ALK2 inhibitors. The colour of each box indicates how viable the cells were at the end (where blue indicates an improvement in viability and red indicates a drop in viability). Each column indicates an individual (technical repeats, n1-3) grouped into those done at the same time (biological repeats 1-3).</p></div>
<p>From that heatmap you can see that M4K2009 is the best at killing ACVR1 mutant cells (the top heatmap), but it isn&#8217;t as effective in cells where the ACVR1 gene is not mutated (&#8220;wild-type&#8221; cells). In those cells instead M4K2096 is the most effective compound (but still not to the same extent as M4K2009).</p>
<p>But this is only the data for cells grown in 2 dimensions without a radiation treatment. If you want to see the full dataset, you can read my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2000673#.XAqo_FX7SUk">Zenodo post</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) is to discover and share selective small molecule inhibitors of protein kinases. Kinases have key roles in cell signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression, metabolism and other significant biological function. Cancers, immunological and metabolic diseases, among other ailments are caused by deregulation of kinase function. Protein kinases are now considered an extremely important group of drug targets, and their inhibitors can have life-saving therapeutic value. In 2001, Imatinib was the first kinase inhibitor was approved for market. Since then over 38 have been approved, with many more in various phases of clinical testing.</p>
<p>My aim within SGC is to develop a selective CaMKK2 chemical probe which will have suitable properties for <em>in vivo </em>testing. CaMKK2 is a serine/threonine kinase. It downstream signaling activates CaMK1, CaMK4 and AMPK, which in turn regulate several distinct and important biological responses. CaMKK2 deregulation is implicated in prostate cancer, breast cancer and hepatic cancer, showing CaMKK2 to be an important target of which selective inhibitors are promptly needed.</p>
<p>Excellent work towards these inhibitors has already been carried out by the SGC. These inhibitors have been mainly based around the furopyridine (1) and quinoline (2) cores.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2036 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pic-1-300x119.png" alt="" width="240" height="95" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pic-1-300x119.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pic-1.png 383w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>The route to the furopyridine core is described in Scheme 1. It generates the furopyridine <strong>7</strong> that has 2 functional handles which can be utilized in a variety of couplings. Under the right conditions there is selective functionalization of the triflate which we have taken advantage of in the library synthesis.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2040 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-300x104.png" alt="" width="621" height="215" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-300x104.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-768x267.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-1024x356.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></p>
<p>In my time with the SGC so far, I have utilized this route to begin generating a library of furopyridine analogues. Although the synthesis to key compound <strong>7</strong> is only 4 steps the yields do mean a significant loss in material. In an attempt to expedite access to <strong>7</strong>, I will attempt a synthesis using Arntd-Eistert chemistry. This chemistry has been effectively applied in the synthesis of benzofurans previously as shown in Scheme 2.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2038 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture3-300x79.png" alt="" width="349" height="92" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture3-300x79.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture3.png 570w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>In my next post I will describe the results of this synthesis, the analogues synthesized so far and any new biological data that has been collected.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the successful synthesis of the furopyridine scaffold via an alternative synthetic route, conditions have been worked out to optimize yields on the synthesis of the key intermediate: 5-bromobenzofuran-3(2H)-one. Thus far the following set of analogs, <strong>Figure 1</strong>, have been generated by building diversity on the pyridine ring. These analogs together with with proposed others and those earlier on synthesized, would help us to better understand the SAR of this series.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Synthesized CaMKK2 Analogs</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1935 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-300x142.png" alt="" width="688" height="326" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-300x142.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-768x363.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-1024x484.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs.png 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above compounds have been submitted for testing and data would be provided as they become available. The highlighted analog, <strong>BE2-084</strong>, was obtained as a result of the unintended hydrolysis of the amide during the final saponification step, <strong>Scheme 1</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 1: Unintended hydrolysis of amide bond</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1936 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-2-300x157.png" alt="" width="399" height="209" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-2-300x157.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-2.png 712w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus it was envisioned that starting from 5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate, <strong>3</strong>, analogs <strong>1</strong> (<strong>BE2-089</strong>) or <strong>2</strong> (<strong>BE2-086</strong>), could be achieved via a one-pot synthesis as depicted below, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>. This route does not require the cyclopentyl acid derivative, <strong>4</strong> [2-cyclopentyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoic acid] to be protected (methyl ester), and a test reaction conducted indicates that this route is possible and details would be provided in due course.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what is planned to be the last small set of compounds prepared as STK17B/DRAK2 kinase inhibitors. Here, chemical modifications are made in the “top part” of the parent compound AP-39.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal is to evaluate the role of other functional groups such as imidazole, tetrazole, and sulfonamides (<strong>1-3</strong>). Other changes include replacement of the sulfur atom by nitrogen or carbon (<strong>4-8</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these compounds, we expect to generate more structure-activity relationship data to understand the role of the thienopyrimidines as inhibitors of this kinase.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every summer my department holds a special mini-conference for the DPhil (aka PhD) students so that we can get to know each other and practice presenting our research.</p>
<p>This year I took along a poster outlining my own project – Understanding the pathogenic mechanism of ACVR1 mutations in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma – and presented it to my peers (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1403108#.W4AH2s5KiUk">you can view it here</a>). I still find presenting my work a nerve-wracking experience, it doesn’t come naturally to me at all, but I really enjoyed the chance to practice, and to take notes on how everyone else is presenting their work.</p>

<p>We also had an enlightening panel discussion about the publishing industry, and a brilliant key-note lecture from <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-10-17-professor-kevin-marsh-recognised-contributions-health-africa">Professor Kevin Marsh</a> about the growth of scientific research in Africa and the <a href="http://www.afox.ox.ac.uk/">Africa Oxford Initiative</a> , which I’ve been chewing over ever since. Sometimes it’s daunting to take time away from the lab, but I find that the things I learn at conferences are always super useful!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Preparation of CaMKK2 analogs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pursuant to our aim of preparing a library of small molecule chemical probes around our most promising core scaffold, furopyridine, we sought to develop different chemistries that would allow us to achieve this objective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original synthetic route, 5-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridine, <strong>1</strong>, was able to undergo the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to install an aryl derivative in compound <strong>2 (Scheme 1)</strong>. This was followed by bromination on the furan ring at the 3-position, which allows the installation of the crucial cyclopentylbenzoic acid derivative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 1: Original Synthetic Route to Furopyridine Analogs</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1621 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1-300x72.png" alt="" width="686" height="165" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1-300x72.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1-768x185.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1.png 942w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ar = variety of aryl groups<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This method led to the preparation of potent CaMKK2 inhibitors. Examples of analogs prepared and their CaMKK2 activities are provided in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1623 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2-300x79.png" alt="" width="630" height="166" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2-300x79.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2-768x202.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2.png 954w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Examples of Previously Prepared Furopyridine Analogs at SGC-UNC</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the synthetic route, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>, required repeating step one (1) for each analog prepared, and the bromination step (step 2) limited diversity on the pendant aryl, as many groups get brominated. <strong>Figure 2</strong>, shows the unintended bromination spot (arrow) on the isoxazole ring, for example.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1625 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/furopyridine-3.png" alt="" width="120" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 2: Multiple brominations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, we envisioned that installing the cyclopentylbenzoic acid derivative early in the synthesis (prior to diversification on the pyridine ring), will not only address the bromination issues, but also contribute to preparation of as many analogs as possible within a short space of time. To achieve this, we sought to prepare 3,5-di-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridine, <strong>5</strong>, 5-bromo-3-iodo[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridine, <strong>6</strong>, or 5-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridin-3-yl-trifluoromethanesulfonate, <strong>7</strong>, compounds, <strong>Figure 3</strong>, with a view to incorporating the cyclopentylbenzoic acid derivative chemoselectively at the 3-position on the furan ring.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1632 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-4-1-300x92.png" alt="" width="355" height="109" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-4-1-300x92.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-4-1.png 459w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 3: Proposed Furopyridine Scaffolds for Selective Suzuki Reactions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The di-bromo compound, <strong>5</strong>, has been achieved but selectivity on the furan ring is poor and we are continuing to review different reaction conditions (Suzuki cross-coupling) to achieve the desired selectivity. Iodination at the 3-position in compound <strong>6</strong> has proven much more difficult than anticipated. In an attempt to achieve the triflate derivative in compound <strong>7</strong>, the following synthetic route has been devised, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 2: Synthesis of  5-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridin-3-yl-trifluoromethanesulfonate</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1634 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-5-300x133.png" alt="" width="512" height="227" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-5-300x133.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-5.png 724w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intermediate ethyl substituted benzoate, <strong>9</strong>,  was easily obtained in good yield via reaction of the acid, <strong>8</strong>, with ethanol in the presence of conc. sulfuric acid (<em>RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 6306, WO 2013/014587</em>). This compound, <strong>9</strong>, was further reacted with ethyl glycolate in the presence of NaH to yield the the bicyclic ester, <strong>10</strong>, (<em>WO 2013/014587</em>) which was refluxed in aqueous NaOH followed by with aqueous HCl to give the key intermediate furopyridinone, <strong>11, </strong>(<em>J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1986, 23, 1465</em>). The compound thus obtained was then converted to the corresponding triflate, <strong>7</strong>, followed by chemoselective palladium-catalyzed coupling with select aryl boronic acids (<em>Synlett 2002, No. 3, 501-503, WO 2010/034671</em>), <strong>Figure 4</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although, steps 2 and 3 (<strong>Scheme 2</strong>) recorded very low yields, <em><strong>gratifyingly</strong></em> we have been able to achieve selectivity for the triflate over the the bromine, with the bromo-derivatives being the only isolable product in most cases, <strong>Figure 4</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 4: Selective Suzuki Cross-Coupling Reaction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furopyridine analog via this new synthetic route has been achieved, <strong>Scheme 3</strong>, and work to create a library of small molecule chemical probes with the promising furopyridine core scaffold is underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 3: Synthesis of 2-cyclopentyl-4-(5-(6-(<wbr />trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl)<wbr />furo[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridin-3-yl)<wbr />benzoic acid</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1645 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-9-300x135.png" alt="" width="660" height="297" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-9-300x135.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-9-768x347.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-9.png 944w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work towards optimizing the yields in the synthetic route described in <strong>Scheme 2</strong> is ongoing. Detailed analogs and their biological data would be provided as they become available.</p>
