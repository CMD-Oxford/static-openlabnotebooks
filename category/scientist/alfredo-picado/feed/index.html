										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Protein STK17A or DRAK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the death-associated protein kinase family (DAPK). This family is comprised of five members: DAPK1, DAPK2, DAPK3, DRAK1 and DRAK2, being the last two the least studied.  As part of our efforts to find inhibitors for understudied kinases, we recently disclosed a high quality chemical probe for DRAK2 (compound <strong>UNC-AP-194</strong>, smiles string O=C(O)CSC1=C2C(C=C(C3=CC(C=CC=C4)=C4S3)S2)=NC=N1). Following these lines, DRAK1 is our next target, for which non selective and potent inhibitors have been found yet. DRAK1 overexpression has been linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The starting point to look for inhibitors was our very own Kinase Chemogenomic Set (KCGS).  From here, compounds annotated as DRAK1 inhibitors with <em>K</em><sub>d</sub> &lt;100 nM were screened for cell potency in a target engagement assay in HEK293 cells using NanoBRET technology, Table 1. This assay was performed by our colleague Julie Pickett.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Most compounds shown cell potency greater than 1 uM and even two resulted inactive.  But more interesting is to see the results for <strong>GSK2283293 and GKS2298859 </strong>(entries 2 &amp; 5) which were screened as racemates showing IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.7 and 7.5 uM respectively, then when their enantiomers were screened individually, one of them resulted completely inactive while the other one shown inhibition activity (e.g., <strong>GSK2283293-F1 </strong>vs<strong> GSK2283293-F2 </strong>and<strong> GKS2298859-F1 </strong>vs<strong> GKS2298859-F2</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GSK2250882, GSK2283293 and GKS2298859 </strong>belong to the family of 3-aminoindazoles, their chemical structures are shown in Figure 1.</p>
<div id="attachment_3952" style="width: 966px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3952" loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DRAK1-aminoindazoles.png" alt="" width="956" height="238" class="size-full wp-image-3952" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DRAK1-aminoindazoles.png 956w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DRAK1-aminoindazoles-300x75.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DRAK1-aminoindazoles-768x191.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3952" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. Selected aminoindazoles from KCGS.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned, most compounds in Table 1 have <em>K</em><sub>d</sub> &lt;100 nM for DRAK1, however this strong biding potency did not translate into a good cell potency and we do not know the reasons yet.  On the other hand, it is clear that different stereoisomers have totally different activity against DRAK1 or in other words for compounds with stereocenters, one enantiomer is active and the other one is not. One of the next steps includes determination of the absolute stereochemistry for enantiomers of <strong>GSK2283293 </strong>and<strong> GKS2298859</strong>, then this information will be used as a starting point to synthesized other DRAK1 inhibitors with the right stereochemistry to improve cell potency in the aminoindazoles series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing with our goal to synthesize three compounds as ALK2 inhibitors, let’s refer back to Scheme 2 in the previous post on this topic, compounds <strong>6</strong>, <strong>8</strong> and <strong>9</strong> were synthesized in good yields (65-90%), however compound <strong>10</strong> could not be obtained.</p>
<div id="attachment_2597" style="width: 748px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2597" loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM.png" alt="" width="738" height="522" class=" wp-image-2597" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM.png 918w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM-300x212.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-19-at-4.22.42-PM-768x544.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2597" class="wp-caption-text">Scheme 2. Synthesis route 1</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Different conditions were tested to induce the cyclization of the bromo-pyrazine-2-carboxamide <strong>9</strong> to the target bromo-pyrazin-2-amine <strong>10</strong>. This reaction mostly yielded starting material <strong>9 </strong>and by-product <strong>11</strong> in low yields (&lt;15%). After several attempts, this approach (acid/heat) was abandoned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2926" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2926" loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-4.17.14-PM.png" alt="" width="736" height="592" class=" wp-image-2926" /><p id="caption-attachment-2926" class="wp-caption-text">Scheme 3. Synthesis route 2</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative synthetic route is shown in Scheme 3.  Here, aminopirazine <strong>12</strong> will be reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) to yield carbaldehyde <strong>13</strong>, which then will be reacted with diamine <strong>6</strong> (previously synthesized) at 200 <sup>o</sup>C using dimethylacetamide (DMA) as a solvent. This last step can be carried out in a microwave reactor and should yield the cyclized compound pyridinpyrazin-2-amine <strong>14</strong>, which can be brominated with <em>N</em>-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) to yield compound <strong>10</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it was mentioned before, <strong>10 </strong>could not be synthesized by the previously proposed route. The new route is adapted from international patent WO 2008/071937 and we hope in this way we can access to this key intermediate in 150-200 mg scale to move forward with more reactions.</p>

<p>The first step will be the synthesis of key intermediate <strong>10</strong>, Scheme 2.  The proposed synthesis begins with a nucleophilic aromatic substitution on compound <strong>4</strong> to get nitropyridine <strong>5</strong>, then reduction with hydrogen on palladium/carbon to obtain the pyridine-3,4-diamine <strong>6</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, aminopyrazine <strong>7</strong> will be saponified to the aminopyrazine sodium salt <strong>8</strong>, which will be coupled with  compound <strong>6</strong> using peptide coupling reagent HATU to form bromopyrazine carboxamide <strong>9</strong>, followed by heating in presence of acetic acid to yield the cyclized intermediate 5-bromo-3-(1-ethyl-1<em>H</em>-imidazo[4,5-<em>c</em>]pyridin-2-yl)pyrazin-2-amine <strong>10</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the line of delivering a chemical probe for DRAK2/STK17B kinase, we decided to revise the procedure to synthesize analogs with a thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine core, which are intended to be used as negative control in our DRAK2 inhibition study.</p>
<p>We shortened the synthesis of these pyrimidines to 2 steps from the starting material 6-bromo-4-chlorothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine <strong>1</strong> and mercaptoacetic acid <strong>2</strong>, Figure 1.  Here, we eliminated a previous step involving the saponification of an ester moiety to get to the carboxylic acid <strong>3</strong>, which is obtained in quantitative yield and easily purified by rinsing with water.</p>
<p>Using this shorter route, we prepared a few analogs <strong>AP-90, AP-94, AP-262-264</strong>, which were recently screened as DRAK2 inhibitors, showing all of them cell potency &gt;10,000 nM; in other words, they are inactive against DRAK2 and because of their structural similarity with the active compounds in this series, they can be used as negative control for future experiments and probe development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what is planned to be the last small set of compounds prepared as STK17B/DRAK2 kinase inhibitors. Here, chemical modifications are made in the “top part” of the parent compound AP-39.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal is to evaluate the role of other functional groups such as imidazole, tetrazole, and sulfonamides (<strong>1-3</strong>). Other changes include replacement of the sulfur atom by nitrogen or carbon (<strong>4-8</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these compounds, we expect to generate more structure-activity relationship data to understand the role of the thienopyrimidines as inhibitors of this kinase.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the series of compounds recently synthesized as thienopyrimidine derivatives we seek selective and potent inhibitors for STK17B/DRAK2 only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To further identify off-target activity of these compounds, NanoBRET assays were implemented in our laboratory to test their potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) with AURKB and STK17A/DRAK1 in cells.  These cellular assays were performed by Carrow Wells and Julie Pickett.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A set of STK17B/DRAK2 inhibitors were tested against AURKB, results are shown below.</p>

Among these, a set of 12 were selected to determine their potency as IC<sub>50</sub> values on a DRAK2 cellular assay. These compounds have different functional groups around the phenyl ring and variation in the position of the sulfur atom in the core of the molecule.  The implementation of the in-house NanoBRET cellular assay was performed for our colleague Carrow Wells.   Results of this assay will be ready in the coming days. Some of the compounds under screening are shown in the scheme below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Towards the SGC goal of creating a kinase chemogenomic set (KCGS) we have been receiving and profiling kinase inhibitors donated by pharmaceutical companies. One such compound is PFE-PKIS 43 (Scheme 1a). We received this compound from Pfizer and it was screened against 403 kinases at DiscoverX. This compound, originally synthesized and published as part of a TPL2 kinase inhibitor program, was found to have a K<sub>d</sub> of 220 nM and 3.8 nM for DRAK1 and DRAK2 respectively. This compound also demonstrated very little activity on other kinases tested however the DiscoverX panel does not include TPL2. DRAK2(STK17B) is a serine/threonine kinase associated with autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Our initial efforts are focused on the synthesis of several thieno[3,2]pyrimidines to generate an understanding of how structural modifications modulate DRAK1 and DRAK2 activity. Synthesis of these thienopyrimidines such as <strong>5</strong> is shown in scheme 1b. The synthetic route (Scheme 1b) begins with the deprotonation/iodination of <strong>1</strong>, nucleophilic aromatic substitution on substrate <strong>2</strong>, saponification of <strong>3</strong> followed by Suzuki coupling of <strong>4</strong> with different arylboronic acids.    (Procedure adapted from Ni, Y. and co-workers. <em>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</em>. <strong>2011</strong>, <em>21</em>, 5952-5956.)</p>
