ALK2 inhibitors</p></div>
<p>The first step will be the synthesis of key intermediate <strong>10</strong>, Scheme 2.  The proposed synthesis begins with a nucleophilic aromatic substitution on compound <strong>4</strong> to get nitropyridine <strong>5</strong>, then reduction with hydrogen on palladium/carbon to obtain the pyridine-3,4-diamine <strong>6</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, aminopyrazine <strong>7</strong> will be saponified to the aminopyrazine sodium salt <strong>8</strong>, which will be coupled with  compound <strong>6</strong> using peptide coupling reagent HATU to form bromopyrazine carboxamide <strong>9</strong>, followed by heating in presence of acetic acid to yield the cyclized intermediate 5-bromo-3-(1-ethyl-1<em>H</em>-imidazo[4,5-<em>c</em>]pyridin-2-yl)pyrazin-2-amine <strong>10</strong>.</p>

<p>If we succeed with the proposed synthesis of imidazopyridine pyrazine <strong>10</strong>, then soon we will present next steps to get to target compounds <strong>1-3</strong></p>
<p>This collaboration is the under supervision of Dr. David Drewry.</p>

<p>We shortened the synthesis of these pyrimidines to 2 steps from the starting material 6-bromo-4-chlorothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine <strong>1</strong> and mercaptoacetic acid <strong>2</strong>, Figure 1.  Here, we eliminated a previous step involving the saponification of an ester moiety to get to the carboxylic acid <strong>3</strong>, which is obtained in quantitative yield and easily purified by rinsing with water.</p>
<p>Using this shorter route, we prepared a few analogs <strong>AP-90, AP-94, AP-262-264</strong>, which were recently screened as DRAK2 inhibitors, showing all of them cell potency &gt;10,000 nM; in other words, they are inactive against DRAK2 and because of their structural similarity with the active compounds in this series, they can be used as negative control for future experiments and probe development.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what is planned to be the last small set of compounds prepared as STK17B/DRAK2 kinase inhibitors. Here, chemical modifications are made in the “top part” of the parent compound AP-39.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal is to evaluate the role of other functional groups such as imidazole, tetrazole, and sulfonamides (<strong>1-3</strong>). Other changes include replacement of the sulfur atom by nitrogen or carbon (<strong>4-8</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these compounds, we expect to generate more structure-activity relationship data to understand the role of the thienopyrimidines as inhibitors of this kinase.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The original compound donated by Pfizer PFE-PKIS 43 (thienopyrimidine scaffold), showed activity against 3 kinases greater than 70% inhibition in the KinomeSCAN at 1 µM (STK17B/DRAK2, AURKB and SRPK2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the series of compounds recently synthesized as thienopyrimidine derivatives we seek selective and potent inhibitors for STK17B/DRAK2 only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To further identify off-target activity of these compounds, NanoBRET assays were implemented in our laboratory to test their potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) with AURKB and STK17A/DRAK1 in cells.  These cellular assays were performed by Carrow Wells and Julie Pickett.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A set of STK17B/DRAK2 inhibitors were tested against AURKB, results are shown below.</p>
<div id="attachment_1557" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-1557" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP-AURKB-Table-1024x587.png" alt="" width="780" height="447" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP-AURKB-Table-1024x587.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP-AURKB-Table-300x172.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP-AURKB-Table-768x440.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP-AURKB-Table.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Table 1. Potency of selected compounds against AURKB and DRAK2</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Table 1 shows good news in terms of selectivity.  All thienopyrimidine compounds resulted <u>inactive towards AURKB</u> while maintaining good cellular potency with DRAK2.  <strong>AP-39 </strong>shown an IC<sub>50</sub> = 19 µM for DRAK1 in the nanoBRET. Compound KW-2449 was used as a control.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several compounds derived from thienopyrimidine scaffolds were recently synthesized to be tested as inhibitors of DRAK2/STK17B kinase. Among these, a set of 12 were selected to determine their potency as IC<sub>50</sub> values on a DRAK2 cellular assay. These compounds have different functional groups around the phenyl ring and variation in the position of the sulfur atom in the core of the molecule.  The implementation of the in-house NanoBRET cellular assay was performed for our colleague Carrow Wells.   Results of this assay will be ready in the coming days. Some of the compounds under screening are shown in the scheme below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Towards the SGC goal of creating a kinase chemogenomic set (KCGS) we have been receiving and profiling kinase inhibitors donated by pharmaceutical companies. One such compound is PFE-PKIS 43 (Scheme 1a). We received this compound from Pfizer and it was screened against 403 kinases at DiscoverX. This compound, originally synthesized and published as part of a TPL2 kinase inhibitor program, was found to have a K<sub>d</sub> of 220 nM and 3.8 nM for DRAK1 and DRAK2 respectively. This compound also demonstrated very little activity on other kinases tested however the DiscoverX panel does not include TPL2. DRAK2(STK17B) is a serine/threonine kinase associated with autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Our initial efforts are focused on the synthesis of several thieno[3,2]pyrimidines to generate an understanding of how structural modifications modulate DRAK1 and DRAK2 activity. Synthesis of these thienopyrimidines such as <strong>5</strong> is shown in scheme 1b. The synthetic route (Scheme 1b) begins with the deprotonation/iodination of <strong>1</strong>, nucleophilic aromatic substitution on substrate <strong>2</strong>, saponification of <strong>3</strong> followed by Suzuki coupling of <strong>4</strong> with different arylboronic acids.    (Procedure adapted from Ni, Y. and co-workers. <em>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</em>. <strong>2011</strong>, <em>21</em>, 5952-5956.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the ongoing projects at SGC-UNC is the development of chemical probes for understudied kinases (e.g. MST1-4, TAOK1-3, DCAMKL1, MAP3K2 and MAP3K3). A chemical probe is defined as a small molecule that selectively and potently modulates a protein’s function. Generating chemical probes for understudied kinases is important so we can further understand the biology of these kinases. To achieve this goal, we are preparing a set of pyrimido-diazepine compounds based around a previously reported scaffold that is potent against several of these understudied kinases that was originally published by Nathanael Gray. In order to understand the SAR (structure activity relationship) we aim to generate several analogs and screen them in biochemical assays to validate their activity. At the same time, linkable versions of some of these compounds will be synthesized that will enable the development of a split-luciferase binding assays for these kinases.  These assays will be developed in collaboration with Luceome Biotechnologies and will help them expand their KinaseSeeker<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Assay panel.</p>
