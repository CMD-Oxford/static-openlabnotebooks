				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One goal of the CaMKK2 project is to explore the chemistry and biology of novel hinge binders. Various hinge binders showing CaMKK2 inhibition have been identified in the literature and through testing of compounds synthesized in the SGC. Of note in this search was a recent publication by Price <em>et al</em>. (<em>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</em>., <strong>2018</strong>, <em>28</em>, 1958–1963), in which molecules based on 7-azaindole (<strong>1,2</strong>) and 2-amino-pyrimidine (<strong>3</strong>) (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) cores showed excellent activity in an enzymatic CaMKK2 assay.</p>
<div id="attachment_2645" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-2645 size-large" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-1-1024x283.png" alt="" width="780" height="216" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-1-1024x283.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-1-300x83.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-1-768x213.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Azaindole based CaMKK2 inhibitors</p></div>
<p>Although the compounds have good potency, they are promiscuous, showing poor selectivity in a small screen against 48-86 different kinases. Indeed between 15-30% of the kinases in the panel were inhibited with an IC<sub>50</sub> &lt;100 nM.</p>
<p>Small modifications to the hinge binding region of pharmacophore can have drastic effects on the binding mode, and therefore the selectivity and potency, of inhibitors. It was decided to probe if <em>N</em>-methylation of the azaindole core could be tolerated in CaMKK2. <em>N</em>-methyl azaindole <strong>4 </strong>(<strong>Figure 1</strong>) was synthesized and sent for testing in a CaMKK2 enzyme inhibition assay. The compounds showed moderate activity giving an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 183 nM. The compound also gave had good solubility (125 µM) and was membrane permeable. It was decided to synthesis a small library of compounds based on <strong>4</strong> to see if more potent compounds based on this scaffold.</p>
<p>The compounds were relatively easy to access synthetically. <em>N</em>-methylation of 2-iodo-4-chloro-7-azaindole followed by two Suzuki couplings and an ester hydrolysis allowed quick access to the desired compounds. Conveniently, both Suzuki coupling could be carried using microwave conditions with reactions going to completion in 30 minutes (<strong>Scheme 1</strong>).</p>
<div id="attachment_2647" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-2647" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Scheme-1-1-1024x245.png" alt="" width="780" height="187" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Scheme-1-1-1024x245.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Scheme-1-1-300x72.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Scheme-1-1-768x184.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Scheme 1</strong>: Sequential Suzuki reactions utilizing a microwave reactor to greatly reduce reaction times.</p></div>
<p>In choosing what analogues to make in the library I wanted to probe the effects of electron withdrawing and donating groups, lipophilicity and to determine the effect of extending the molecules with morpholino- groups pointing out of the binding pocket towards the solvent. The library of compounds synthesized is shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2648" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-2648" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-1024x515.png" alt="" width="780" height="392" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-1024x515.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-300x151.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Figure-2-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2: Library of N-methyl-azaindoles synthesized and sent for a CaMKK2 enzyme inhibition assay.</p></div>
<p>The compounds have been shipped and we are awaiting the results from the enzyme inhibition assay. If any of the compounds have good activity, the best will be sent for a selectivity profiling using KINOMEscan screening platform provided by DiscoverX. From this we will learn if <em>N</em>-methylation can indeed modulate selectivity across the kinome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) is to discover and share selective small molecule inhibitors of protein kinases. Kinases have key roles in cell signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression, metabolism and other significant biological function. Cancers, immunological and metabolic diseases, among other ailments are caused by deregulation of kinase function. Protein kinases are now considered an extremely important group of drug targets, and their inhibitors can have life-saving therapeutic value. In 2001, Imatinib was the first kinase inhibitor was approved for market. Since then over 38 have been approved, with many more in various phases of clinical testing.</p>
<p>My aim within SGC is to develop a selective CaMKK2 chemical probe which will have suitable properties for <em>in vivo </em>testing. CaMKK2 is a serine/threonine kinase. It downstream signaling activates CaMK1, CaMK4 and AMPK, which in turn regulate several distinct and important biological responses. CaMKK2 deregulation is implicated in prostate cancer, breast cancer and hepatic cancer, showing CaMKK2 to be an important target of which selective inhibitors are promptly needed.</p>
<p>Excellent work towards these inhibitors has already been carried out by the SGC. These inhibitors have been mainly based around the furopyridine (1) and quinoline (2) cores.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2036 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pic-1-300x119.png" alt="" width="240" height="95" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pic-1-300x119.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pic-1.png 383w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>The route to the furopyridine core is described in Scheme 1. It generates the furopyridine <strong>7</strong> that has 2 functional handles which can be utilized in a variety of couplings. Under the right conditions there is selective functionalization of the triflate which we have taken advantage of in the library synthesis.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2040 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-300x104.png" alt="" width="621" height="215" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-300x104.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-768x267.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PIc-2-1024x356.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></p>
<p>In my time with the SGC so far, I have utilized this route to begin generating a library of furopyridine analogues. Although the synthesis to key compound <strong>7</strong> is only 4 steps the yields do mean a significant loss in material. In an attempt to expedite access to <strong>7</strong>, I will attempt a synthesis using Arntd-Eistert chemistry. This chemistry has been effectively applied in the synthesis of benzofurans previously as shown in Scheme 2.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2038 aligncenter" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture3-300x79.png" alt="" width="349" height="92" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture3-300x79.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Picture3.png 570w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>In my next post I will describe the results of this synthesis, the analogues synthesized so far and any new biological data that has been collected.</p>
