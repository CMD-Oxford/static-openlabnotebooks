				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I’m still ‘trying to catch them all’ as the young folks say (!) and building up my collection of purified GS loop mutations so that I can test them all together and start building up a picture of what phosphorylation sites are necessary for SMAD1 activation and which are not.</p>
<p>This time around I was aided ably by Jong Fu who was trying his hand at protein purification for the first time. I think (at least I hope!) you’ll agree he did a pretty good job!</p>
<p>The two mutants we were purifying this time were c108 and c133 which contain one and three mutations respectively. We were also purifying a fresh set of ACVR2A as the last test I did showed no SMAD1 activity (I’m going to write about this in the next blog post along with the follow-up experiment I did with this purification of ACVR2) but did show ACVR1 autophosphorylation suggesting the type I was active but something had happened to the type II protein to inactivate it.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png" alt="" width="780" height="324" class="alignnone wp-image-3300 size-large" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-300x124.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-768x318.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations.png 1165w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Fig. 1 – Showing the phospho-mutations introduced into the GS domain of ALK2</em>.</p>
<p>This time around we also tried a slightly different method of purification using Talon resin bound to cobalt ions rather than using nickle – partly this was because our nickle resin was in a sorry state after many regenerations and partly this was because we’d got access to some cobalt talon resin from the membrane protein group who, because they require super clean resin for each purification, only use it once and then pass it onto other groups for use with higher expressing proteins.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-1024x584.png" alt="" width="780" height="445" class="alignnone wp-image-3775 size-large" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-1024x584.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-300x171.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification-768x438.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Talon_purification.png 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Fig. 2. SDS-PAGE gel of Talon column purification for all constructs showing flowthrough, washes and elutions. Boxed fractions have Tev added and taken on to gel filtration purification.</em></p>
<p>As you can see the talon resin worked out really well and we ended up with a really decent purification from it. The boxed fractions we cleaved overnight with Tev protease to remove the His tag and then concentrated them down to &lt;5ml to purify on a GF75 size exclusion column.</p>
<p>This is shown in the gel below – in this case the boxed fractions are the ones chosen to be taken on for use in experiments – the other fractions, even though they contain the protein of interest, weren’t part of the main gel filtration peak and thus probably represent aggregates of the protein that we don’t want.</p>
<p>We then concentrated down the samples and froze them ready for future assays.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been working recently on purifying some proteins for use in future experiments and wanted to explain a little bit about what I need each construct for as they’re all for different things. Purification, as always, is a time consuming business but vital for any biophysical experiment that I do given all my work is in vitro rather than in a cellular context. It’s important to know what you’re putting in any given experiment so that you can interpret the results accurately!</p>
<p>The three proteins I was purifying were:</p>
<p><strong>ALK2</strong> – a short version of the construct containing the Kinase domain only, no GS loop, and a Q207D mutation that makes it consituativly active. We use this construct regularly for co-crystallisation studies and in this case I need some of it for growing some crystals for some mini-fragment screening later on.</p>
<p><strong>ALK2 GS loop mutant</strong> – as described previously, we’ve mutated out various different phosphorylation sites in different combinations within the GS loop of ALK2 to see how this effects the activity. Overall we have 12 different version of this protein, this is one of them. I want to purify several so that I can compare them directly in an experiment all at once.</p>
<p><strong>SUFU</strong> – so this is a slightly different project harking back to some stuff I did a few years ago so bear with me. In the BMP signalling pathway there is a protein called Endofin (ZFYVE16) which is involved in endosomal signalling/trafficking and may have some role in membrane localisation of the receptors and/or their substrates. In the TGFβ pathway the equivalent protein is called SARA and I managed to crystallise a previously unknown domain (a DUF domain or ‘domain of unknown function’) which is in the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4BKW">pdb as 4BKW</a>. This domain had three sub-folds, two of which were known and one of which was novel. The two familiar folds looked a lot like SUFU which is part of the Hedgehog signalling pathway although there is practically no sequence similarity. It is known that Endofin and SARA bind to the protein TOM1 which is also thought to be involved in trafficking. To confirm whether there is a structural or sequence basis to the binding, one test would be to see if TOM1 also associates with SUFU – given the sequence differences between SUFU and SARA it is highly unlikely that TOM1 will bind but it’s worth testing just in case. I obtained a plasmid for an E.coli expressible version of SUFU from <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/christian-siebold">Christian Seibold</a> and a large scale culture was grown up by Charlotte Manning, our new lab assistant.</p>
<p>I’m happy to say that all constructs expressed well and are now safely frozen at -80°C (GS loop AKL2 mutant and SUFU) or used to set up in crystal plates for mini-fragment screening which I’ll do a separate post about soon.</p>
<p>I’ve also manged to grow up a large scale culture of TOM1 (6L of cells) which I’ll set about purifying probably next week so I can then test whether it binds to SUFU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find all the experimental details<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3507756"> over on Zenodo.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello folks, another day another deposition. That makes it sound horribly commonplace but actually Ros put in immense effort into crystallising and solving these proteins and it’s my job just to add the final polish (fix those last stubborn geometry errors), give it a once over to make sure there’s nothing obviously wrong, and whip it into shape to put into the PDB.</p>
<p>This one is another of the M4K structures, this time with M4K2009 which is one of our most promising candidates as shown by Jong Fu and colleagues and is one of the ones being taken forward into more tests. There were two molecules of ALK2 in the asymmetric unit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-1024x587.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="447" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3645" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-300x172.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1-768x440.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Picture1.jpg 1183w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>A: Overall structure of ALK2 bound to M4K2009. B: Details of the molecule M4K2009. C: Closeup of the binding pocket showing water mediated H bonds between molecule and side-chains and directly between M4K2009 and the protein hinge region.</p>
<p>The structure is what we expect in a sense, the overall structure of the kinase domain is very similar to usual. Of most interest is the position of water molecules in the binding pocket that help mediate contacts between the protein and the ligand – these help improve the stability and the fit of the compound in the binding site</p>
<p>One other thing of note was the presence of two additional ligand molecules bound to the top of one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit. It is unlikely that these are physiologically relevant and are most likely there as a crystallographic artefact as they are making good contact with chains from the neighbouring unit cell in the crystal.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/odd_ligands-292x300.png" alt="" width="292" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3644" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/odd_ligands-292x300.png 292w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/odd_ligands.png 736w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></p>
<p>Structure of one copy of ALK2 in the asymmetric unit showing two additional M4K2009 compounds bound non-physiologically at the crystallographic interface.</p>
<p>I used the standard wwPDB One Dep system and this structure has been assigned the code: 6SZM and should be released into the wild (that is, once it has been curated by the people at the pdb) asap!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the big aims of the M4K project was to look at the structure of potentially interesting molecules bound to the protein ALK2 and use that to try and design better molecules that might be useful in the treatment of the rare childhood brain cancer, DIPG. Ros did a lot of work on this project and documented a lot of it on her blog. Although currently this project has moved beyond the structure stage, there are still quite a lot of structures that need the final step of tidying up and then depositing into the PDB.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks among the other things I’ve needed to do, I’ve also managed to deposit the first of these structure – ALK2 bound to M4K2117.</p>
<p>This compound showed good potency as has been tested by Jong Fu and is one of the more promising compounds (of which there are around 5) with regards to both potency and selectivity for taking forward to the next stage of the process for more in-depth and extensive testing in both cell and animal models.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M4K2117-1024x677.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="516" class="alignnone wp-image-3577 size-large" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M4K2117-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M4K2117-300x198.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M4K2117-768x508.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M4K2117.jpg 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

<p>The final tweaks to the structures were made using Phenix Refine and Coot while I used the standard wwPDB One Dep system and this structure has been assigned the code: <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6SRH">6SRH</a></p>
<p>The files for the deposition can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3460724">over on Zenodo</a> and of course you can download the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6SRH">PDB from the PDB website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been getting my stocks in order recently and catching up on some other work which has been both busy but not the most thrilling in terms of experimental results. As such I’ve not had much time to write up a blog post so I’ll try and get back on top of that although it’s not likely to be that world shattering.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to purify versions of ALK2 where various phosphorylation sites at the top of the molecule have been mutated out so that we can see what influence each of the phospho-sites has on the overall activity of ALK2 and hopefully from that work out which sites are essential for ALK2’s function and which are merely ‘nice to haves’ or even not necessary at all. This will hopefully then combine with our study of the mutant version of ALK2 to try and see whether the mutation that causes FOP is interfering with this phosphorylation activation. Anyway – that’s the ultimate goal, in the mean time I’ve been slowly purifying more constructs so that I can do a big experiment comparing all the different constructs at the same time. The main reason I want to do them all at once is to try and minimise the variability that can occur between experimental runs despite best efforts to make everything identical. If I’m actually using the same stock of partner proteins and ATP and metal ions and incubating them for exactly the same time it makes the comparisons between the mutants easier and less likely to contain artefact errors.</p>

<p>So – with that I’ve been stockpiling the various mutants as they come through the expression pipeline at the SGC. This time around I’ve been purifying three more constructs – ACVR1-105, 106 and 109 (constructs 107 and 108 and beyond are still to be sorted). <em>(Just a quick reminder that ALK2 and ACVR1 are different ways of referring to the same thing, technically ALK2 is the protein and ACVR1 is the gene)</em></p>
<p>I had a bit of a problem with some of them – I’m not sure why but they seem to require more Nickle resin than usual to purify compared to the wild type construct – I’m not sure if that’s because the mutation makes it harder for the tag to contact the resin or if it is because there is more background contamination than usual in this particular line of cells or whether it’s something else. Luckily they can be rescued through re-incubating the sample with more nickle to pull out the protein and continuing on as usual. This is, while annoying, not a complete loss so while I’m keen to find out why it’s behaving differently it’s not ruined my purification prep.</p>
<p>There are still a couple of constructs left to purify before I run the big experiment and there are a few other small optimisations I need to do as well but I’m getting closer to really getting to the bottom of this question.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;and analysing their activity!</p>
<p>Following on from the work I talked about <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/phosphorylation-over-time-and-phosphomapping-experiments-to-investigate-the-influence-of-alk2-mutations-on-activity/">here</a> I’ve been able to start looking at the influence the different phosphorylation sites have over the ability of ALK2 to activate SMAD1.</p>
<p>Just coming through the SGC expression pipeline are several constructs containing mutations in various combinations of the sites known to be phosphorylated in and around the ‘GS loop’ of ALK2. This will prevent phosphorylation on that site and the change that makes to the activity of ALK2 will tell us something about how that site influences ALK2 function. These are shown in the figure below. Here they’re all labelled as ACVR1 due to our internal system using the gene name rather than the protein name.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png" alt="" width="780" height="324" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3300" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-1024x425.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-300x124.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations-768x318.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gsloop_mutations.png 1165w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>A list of ALK2 constructs containing mutations in the GS loop region of the protein. The mutations are from either Ser or Thr to Ala to knock out phosphorylation on that site.</em></p>
<p>One of the key findings from my previous experiments was that there seemed to be some sites that needed to be phosphorylated for maximal activation of SMAD – for example when a kinase dead type II binding partner was used some sites were not phosphorylated on ALK2 and this also corresponded to a reduction in SMAD1 phosphorylation. These mutants should help me explore which sites are vital for ALK2 activity and ultimately help me understand why the FOP mutation causes increased activity.</p>
<p>Anyway… now that these have been cloned into a baculo expression vector I can start actually purifying the protein and doing some experiments with them.</p>
<p>I had 1l of c103 cells and c104 cells which I purified with fairly high yields. I also had 1l of c105 cells but something went really wrong with the purification and I ended up not having enough to do any actual experiments with. I arranged to get some more c105 cells and 1l c106 cells but while those were being grown I went ahead and did a small scale experiment looking at how c103 and c104 behaved in comparison to the wild type ALK2.</p>
<p>I used my standard assay for monitoring SMAD1 phosphorylation. I incubated SMAD1 with ALK2 and with a type II receptor (in this case ACVR2 and BMPR2) at high enough concentrations to allow receptor association under normal circumstances. I then added activating quantities of ATP along with DTT, Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions necessary for activity and took 1ul samples at regular time intervals up to 30 minutes. The samples were quenched in MS buffer (which contains enough acid to stop any phosphorylation by a kinase) and at the end the results were run on the mass spec machine. Full details of the experimental protocol and the purification can be found over on Zenodo.</p>
<p>The results were fairly interesting but without other experiments remain somewhat inconclusive.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-1024x274.png" alt="" width="780" height="209" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3301" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-1024x274.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-300x80.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMAD1_P-768x205.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

<p>What I can see is that compared to wildtype ALK2, it looks like there is much reduced phosphorylation on SMAD1 using the phosphomutants over 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I also looked at the phosphorylation of ALK2 in this experiment which can be seen in the figure below. This shows that there is a reduction of one occupied phosphorylation site compared to WT which is to be expected given one site has been removed by mutation however given we know from other experiments that there are up to 8 possible phosphorylation sites it’s not clear if the mutation is influencing which of these sites then is occupied.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-1024x265.png" alt="" width="780" height="202" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3299" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-1024x265.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-300x78.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ALK2_P-768x199.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Graphs showing the mass peaks detected by mass spec for ALK2 in it’s unphosphorylated state and in various states of phosphorylation at +80 Da intervals at both 0min and 25min for ALK2 wild type, ALK2 c103 and ALK2 c104 mutants.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>There are questions unanswered however, such as do the mutations reduce the affinity between the type I and type II proteins such that a higher concentration might be needed to induce association (given that we already need to artificially induce their association via high concentrations to make up for the lack of membrane co-localisation that would occur in the cell) and if left for longer, would they show some activity rather than practically nothing? This suggests my next line of experimental inquiry which will be to alter the concentration of proteins in my experimental setup to see if increasing the concentrations of ALK2 and ACVR2 make any difference to the results in comparison to a wild type control. I’ll also let the experiment run for longer to see if this gives any indication as to whether the activity has been stopped or merely reduced. Increasing the time will also help pick up any differences in ALK2 phosphorylation as it may allow more sites to become occupied and thus pick up any limitations that the mutation is putting on that aside from the removal of one site by the mutation its self.</p>
<p>I’ll also think about looking at SMAD1 phosphorylation by western blot in addition to mass spec as we have a good antibody for looking at specifically phosphorylated SMAD1 which will show up very small amounts of phosphorylated SMAD1 that the mass spec might miss.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry I’ve not written for a while. I had some annual leave to use up and then I’ve been helping out with a residential EMBO course that was being co-organised by one of the group leaders in my department. The course was an introduction to a wide variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. I was helping out with a purification comparison between nickel resin, talon (cobalt) resin and streptactin resin and talking a bit about thermal shift assays.</p>
<p>Anyway, on with the science!</p>
<p><strong>TNIK Selectivity:</strong></p>
<p>TNIK is a protein kinase that Ros has previously talked about as being a potential off target hit for many of the M4K compounds along with DDR1. It is highly expressed in the brain which makes it of relevance to drug discovery for DIPG. Although its function is not entirely clear we know over-expression leads to cell rounding and it has been linked to some cell signalling effects in certain cancers. What makes it of most interest to us is that it seems to phosphorylate SMAD1 in an inhibitory position away from the tail where ALK2 phosphorylates SMAD1. Theoretically phosphorylation of SMAD1 by TNIK should inhibit phosphorylation elsewhere on SMAD1 by ALK2. This might make TNIK an indirect inhibitor of ALK2 function and thus we don’t want any drug we design against ALK2 to also hit TNIK.</p>
<p>I was working with a student, Mira Rothweiler, who purified TNIK that we then used in further experiments. Details for the purification can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3257646">Zenodo</a> along with other details of the experiments done.</p>
<p>I have used Tm shift analysis (which is where you look at the change in melting point of a protein caused by the binding of a ligand, the tighter it binds the more it stabilises the protein and thus the larger the shift) to look at the binding of TNIK to all the M4K compounds and compared it to the shifts seen in ALK2. I plotted this data against each other with ALK2 shifts along the x-axis and the TNIK shifts along the y-axis. When compared against a 1:1 line, anything below the line is likely to be more selective for ALK2, anything above the line is likely to be selective for TNIK and anything close to the line shows minimal selectivity.</p>
<p>The data shows that while there are a small handful of M4K compounds that do hit TNIK, the vast majority seem to have a relatively low effect on TNIK and a high effect on ALK2 suggesting they are selective. One of the most promising M4K targets (M4K2009) gives a 14.1 °C shift for ALK2 but only 1.8 °C for TNIK. This is really good news.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-816x1024.png" alt="" width="780" height="979" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3017" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-816x1024.png 816w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-239x300.png 239w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tm_shifts_TNIK-768x964.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Tm shift results for ALK2 vs. TNIK for all M4K compounds. Top panel: plates K115 and K116. Bottom panel: plates K117 and K118.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>TNIK activity:</strong></p>
<p>While it has been reported that TNIK phosphorylates SMAD1 in a non-standard location in vivo, I wanted to see if I could get the same effect in vitro in my own experiments. I mixed SMAD1 with TNIK in different concentrations and for different lengths of time and took samples to run on mass spec to see whether SMAD1 was getting phosphorylated. My results showed that with concentrations of TNIK of 10mM and over after just 10 minutes I was starting to see phosphorylation on SMAD1. However this doesn’t tell me where that phosphorylation is happening.</p>
<p>I used another mass spec technique called ‘phosphomapping’ to identify where the phosphate was being added. Dr. Rod Chalk helped me with this for which I’m very thankful. This technique involved chopping the protein up into known chunks using different proteases that cut the protein at specific predictable places. We used five different proteases on different samples from the same incubation that all cut in different locations and then with each of the samples we ran half of it on the mass spec as was, and with the other half passed it over a Ti/Zr column to enrich the phosphopeptides within it and then ran it on the mass spec. The peptides detected are then run against a database of expected peptides created from knowing both the sequence of the protein and where the protease would have cut and then allowing for the possibility of modifications such as phosphorylation.</p>
<p>From this we detected a number of different phosphorylation sites on both SMAD1 and TNIK which are summarised in the diagram below.</p>

<p><em>Summary of identified peptides showing overall coverage (red), definitive phosphorylation (blue) and ambiguous phosphorylation (orange). Consensus site for TNIK phosphorylation of SMAD1 from Wang et. al. 2016 shown boxed in blue.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of sites were identified on TNIK which must be due to auto-phosphorylation. Three sites were identified on SMAD1 definitively and a further three ambiguously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three of these sites (one firm and two ambiguous &#8211; PI<strong>SS</strong>V<strong>S</strong>) are known sites of phosphorylation by ALK2 however we know that ALK2 cannot phosphorylate them alone and requires a type II receptor for this to happen – it seems that under in-vitro conditions TNIK is not under the same restriction.</li>
<li>One of these sites (FE<strong>T</strong>VY) is not known to be involved in SMAD1 inhibition but it cannot be ruled out yet and may bear further investigation</li>
<li>Two of these sites (one firm and one ambiguous – RN<strong>ST</strong>IE) are in the location suggested by Wang et. al. (2016) as being the consensus sequence for TNIK phosphorylation of SMAD1.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next thing to check will be if SMAD phosphorylated in the ‘inhibitory’ position stops ALK2 from phosphorylating SMAD in the ‘normal’ position.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the crystals from my last post I sent them along on the last Diamond trip we had to <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I04">beamline I04</a> but regrettably didn’t get any usable datasets. Perhaps fortunately there is a possible explanation for this that isn’t just ‘the crystals were a bit too rubbish’. We send our crystals to the Diamond Light Source and because of the high number of crystals sent on each trip by the department (124 on the last trip) not everyone goes along on every trip and we quite often use something called ‘auto-centering’ that uses a computer algorithm to find the edge of the loop and to align the loop and your crystal in the beam. Centering is necessary but also quite tricky, because to collect a data set you need ‘slices’ of data taken with the crystal at different angles so the loop the crystals are mounted in, is rotated by a robotic arm so that the crystal also rotates around inside the x-ray beam. Thus if your crystal isn’t aligned properly, as the loop rotates it moves you crystal out of the beam and thus you get no data at that point.</p>
<p>Usually the automatic alignment is really good, however this time around it didn’t work so well and quite often either my crystal wasn’t in the beam at all (it mistook the loop stem for the crystal) or it started in the beam and then rotated out of it (which is what I think happened in the case shown below where you can see two ‘periods’ of data with dips in between. This is, of course, suboptimal and leads to a data set that you can’t really use.</p>
<p>I’m resending the crystals to the beamline this Friday and hopefully going with them myself. The silver lining to this is that I know that some of them definitely diffract which is encouraging. Hopefully they’ll behave well when fully in the beam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been lucky enough to have a student (Mira) in the lab working with me for the past few weeks and so I’d like to write about the work that we’ve been doing together.</p>
<p>We spent some time cleaning up an old sample of ALK2 that Ros had left over in the freezer to set up in crystal plates with some compounds from M4K Pharma that they were relatively keen to see the structures of.</p>
<p>We used a specialised coarse screen that Ros had designed containing only conditions where we had previously seen crystals in the wider coarse screens. This means that we can narrow down the field where we’re expecting to find crystals and test fewer conditions to find the one we need – this means setting up fewer plates and thus needing less protein per compound tested, so is overall more efficient.</p>
<p>We set up the plates (at 4C and 20C) at around 9mg/ml with compounds M4K2163, M4K2143, M4K2192, M4K2207 and M4K2194 at 1mM concentration from 25mM stocks.</p>
<p>We found some interesting crystals, one of which was mountable as is (from M4K2192) and several across all the compounds, which showed small crystals that would be worth following up in more specific conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Mira designed some follow up screens based on the conditions that showed small crystals and we set up some more plates with those conditions in the hope of turning those small crystals into larger, better crystals. We had enough protein to set up followup plates for compounds M4K2163 and M4K2143 at 9.5mg/ml. From these plates we mounted 5 crystals across the board and combined with those above ended up with crystals of unknown quality across three compounds. These have been confirmed as containing protein by imaging the drops by UV light (UV light interacts with protein to make crystals only visible under UV light if they contain protein rather than just being salt) and are now waiting to be sent to the synchrotron to see if they actually diffract or not.  You can read more about the technical details <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2650203#.XMB29jBKiUk">here on Zenodo.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve got a few things to catch up with on the blog – one of them is to talk about a conference I attended in Oxford recently. I attended the <a href="https://www.biochemistry.org/Events/tabid/379/MeetingNo/SA217/view/Conference/Default.aspx">Biochemical Society BMP Signalling in Cancer II</a> meeting which was held in St. Annes College, Oxford. At this meeting I presented a poster on the work I’ve been doing (and which has been written about here as it’s happened) on looking at how the mutations in ALK2 effect the underlying activity of the kinase as well as effecting how well FKBP12 can inhibit ALK2.</p>
<p>The conference brought together 60 researchers in the field from around the world talking about a variety of different cancers but also other BMP related conditions such as FOP. Over three days there were some fantastic talks by the leaders in the field including from Dr. Caroline Hill from the Crick Institute in London who spoke about receptor cross talk in BMP signalling and how that might affect signalling through ALK2 and Prof. Eileen Shore from the university of Pennsylvania who spoke about mechanosensing and tissue stiffness in FOP.</p>
<p>I had a chance to get into some really interesting conversations with some of the attendees about the way their work and my work intersected and how we might be able to collaborate in the future – particularly interesting was talking to some Postdocs from Caroline Hill’s group who are looking at similar problems to me but from an in-cell perspective rather than using purified proteins. From that some interesting questions have been thrown up that I now want to test in my in-vitro systems and that will be detailed here as and when I’ve had a chance to try them. Hopefully this can lead to validation of both my work and theirs by complementing in-vivo and in-vitro approaches.</p>
<p>I thought it would be good to share the poster I created here – so you can find it <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2640488#.XLRgljBKiUk">over on Zenodo</a>. It is designed for a scientific audience but not necessarily an FOP specialist audience so hopefully it should be fairly easy to follow. It leads the reader through the story of explaining that Gain of Function (GOF) mutations in ALK2 are involved in diseases like FOP and DIPG. I then go on to present data that shows that these mutations disrupt the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12 but that this isn’t the whole story (as regular readers of this blog will know). Then I talk about what I found out about what is needed for SMAD activation by ALK2 before looking at the increased phosphorylation of SMAD1 by the mutant ALK2 proteins compared to the wild type. This covers both the western blot data that shows more SMAD1 activation but also the mass spec data I’ve shared previously that looks at more SMAD1 and more ALK2 phosphorylation. Finally I showed the phosphomapping data on ALK2 that is starting to pick apart the exact phosphorylation locations on ALK2 that are necessary for SMAD1 activation (Also data I’ve talked about on this blog before). In this case it was nice to see that all the effort Rod and I had put into phosphomapping had paid off! Other groups had said they’d tried and been unable to map ALK2 using trypsin alone but our method of using 5 different enzymes both enriched and unenriched seems to have done the trick (despite it being 10x more work!).</p>
<p>There is great value from attending a conference like this and in this case I feel that I really did make some very important connections and had some very informative discussions that were directly relevant to my research and that will hopefully bear fruit in time and guide the direction of my experiments.</p>
