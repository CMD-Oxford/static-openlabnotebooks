				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ZFYVE9C (Otherwise known as SARA) is a scaffold protein involved in the association of various protein components as part of the TGFB signalling pathway. The equivalent in the BMP signalling pathway is a protein known as Endofin so studying SARA (which is slightly easier) might give us useful insights for both proteins. For more details on this project please see <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/a-summary-of-my-alk2-project-goals/">this blog post.</a></p>
<p>One of the unanswered questions about SARA is what does one of the major domains that it has actually do? (The domain is known as a DUF domain, or a Domain of Unknown Function!) We know the structure but that hasn’t given us any clues as to its function. One thought was that it might be involved in recruiting type I or type II receptors close to their binding partners such as one of the SMADs to allow signal propagation.</p>
<p>I purified the DUF domain of SARA and mixed it with either excess TGFBR1 or excess TGFBR2 (the two relevant receptors in the TGFB pathway). I tested the receptors in both the unphosphorylated (inactive) and phosphorylated (active) states. After incubating the samples for 30 minutes while concentrating the volume back down to &lt;5ml, I ran them down a gel filtration column to see if the two proteins bound together sufficiently to shift the peaks coming off the column which would indicate they were acting as a complex of larger mass.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2516" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-1024x491.png" alt="" width="780" height="374" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-1024x491.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-300x144.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c-768x368.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gf_trace_zfyve9c.png 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Overlay of the UV traces from all the size exclusion gel filtration runs to show the relative elution volumes of the peaks confirming no shift in the ZFYVE9C peak consistent with no complex being formed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn’t see any shift in the peak for SARA suggesting that either the two proteins don’t bind or that the affinity is weak enough that they fall apart under the conditions of the gel filtration column.</p>
<p>The next thing to try will be to purify the proteins again but not to cleave the tag on one of the binding partners (either the receptors or the SARA protein) and try to do a pull down experiment to test whether this shows any association or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I’d spend a blog post just talking about the various paths of my research and try and tie it all together. A lot of my experiments do dot around these various arms of investigation and so one experimental post doesn’t necessarily tie in directly with the previous one or the next one and I thought it might be a good idea to explain why and summarise where I’m up to with each strand.</p>
<p>My main focus of research is to investigate the cause of the disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). We know that it’s caused by a mutation in ALK2 which leads to excessive bone formation. This also nicely dovetails with research done into DIPG where 25% of cases share a mutation with FOP in ALK2.</p>
<p>My research can be broken down in to three main strands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is looking at characterising the binding of ligands to ALK2 in order to optimise binding and work towards finding a potent and specific inhibitor. This is the focus of a lot of the M4K work that Jong Fu and Ros are doing and I’ve been doing a little bit of that as well but it’s not the main focus of my work. This endeavour is going fairly well – despite setbacks relating to protein expression (which are not entirely solved – we now have regained expression of the kinase domain alone but we still don’t have expression of the kinase domain and GS loop construct) and Ros has a number of structures that she’s working on at the moment that have been recently collected. Alas I’ve not had as much luck with new structures recently. We frequently get new deliveries of compounds from M4K to test – Jong Fu looks at them in cells while Ros and I try and crystallise the most promising candidates with varying degrees of success. Ros and I have also attempted XChem fragment screening which is where we use high throughput crystallography to identify small weakly bound fragments that might identify new leads for drug design or in our case, help us identify drugs that might bind to a second allosteric site within ALK2 away from the main ligand binding pocket. An XChem update will be coming soon from either Ros or myself as I’ve recently started helping her with this aspect of the work and so have been shadowing her on our last couple of visits to Diamond.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The second is investigating the interactions of the type I receptor (ALK2) with its partnering type II in order to activate SMAD 1/5/8. This covers looking at receptor cross reactivity, SMAD cross reactivity, and the influence of mutations on this. This also involves looking at crystal structures of the mutants where possible, attempting to make complexes of the type I and type II receptors in order to try and crystallise them and probing the activities of the proteins and the various disease mutants. Covered in this is everything I’ve done using western blots and mass spec to identify the dependencies of this complex as required for SMAD phosphorylation. So far I know that the mutants are more active than the wild type (with R206H being the most active ALK2 mutation), that the type II must be present but does not need to be active to allow for SMAD activation and that increased activity is not solely dependent upon the removal of inhibition by FKBP12. Covered in this is also the work looking at mapping the phosphorylation sites in ALK2 to try and identify if some of these sites are more critical than others with relation to SMAD activation. The cloning I recently talked about is part of this investigation, making mutations to remove certain phosphorylation sites and comparing the activity of these with the wild type. As soon as these constructs have been cloned into suitable expression vectors I’ll be starting that experiment too. Another aspect of this is looking at the association of other proteins with the receptors, such as the possible link between them and XIAP as I talked about in one earlier blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The third aspect is looking other proteins related to the ALK2 pathway such as Endofin. Endofin is a membrane associated protein with multiple domains including a SMAD binding domain and large areas of unknown function. It is involved with the co-localisation of various parts of the pathway and appears to act as something of a scaffold protein to hold things in close proximity for signal propagation. The equivalent protein in the TGFβ pathway is called SARA and appears to have a similar function in that pathway. Some time ago I solved the structure for a domain of unknown function within SARA (4BKW) which contained a novel fold and showed structural (but not sequence) similarity to a protein called SUFU, which is part of the Hedgehog signalling pathway. We still don’t know what this protein and domain does or what it binds to or how it functions and so this is another area of investigation. If we can uncover the function of SARA we can also try and uncover the function of Endofin and this might provide a better understanding of the way FOP mutations work and help us see if there are any other ways we can target the pathway that are not exclusively based on inhibiting ALK2 activity. However given that the DUF domain has very little information about it, our investigations into what it does have been limited thus far. My goals with this are to try and probe the role of the DUF domain looking for whether it binds to either of the type I or type II receptors, and if so which parts of the receptors, or if it associates with a different protein all together. Given we know very little about what it does and the structure offers few clues (the lack of sequence similarity to SUFU means that although we can predict a possible binding mode, the nature of what binds there is very hard to determine as there are no conserved residues) this is quite a difficult problem to approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My work moves between these three strands depending on how much and which proteins I’ve got available to me &#8211; do I have any in the freezer already purified or do I need to make fresh? And that’s if I have the pellets in the freezer of the expressed protein in the first place. It also varies depending on whether we have new compounds we’re interested in testing immediately from either M4K or other collaborators, or whether I’ve got data I need to analyse from previous successful crystallisation attempts. Sometimes I’ll be looking at my own structural data and sometimes I’ll be looking at someone else’s structure which we call ‘proofreading’ to double check it for errors and make sure nothing has been missed. Sometimes we’ll have time at Diamond and so everything else has to be put on hold in order to make use of that visit (such as XChem trips) and sometimes there’s a lot of data analysis to do on other experiments &#8211; writing it up and understanding what the data is telling us is just as important for progress as the experiments themselves.</p>
<p>Having the three strands means I can move from one to another as each strand has its own peaks and lulls in activity at different times. I’m afraid it does make for a slightly more disjointed blog journey but I hope you’ll bear with me through it all as I try and make sense of the problems I’m investigating.</p>
<p>I’ll try and post again sooner rather than later on what I’ve been doing in January as it has been really rather bitty and frustrating in terms of things actually working but hopefully February will bring with it some more productive experiments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One problem with working with the isolated kinase domains of ALK2 and it’s type II binding partners, is that the affinity between the kinase domains alone is insufficient to allow complex formation. We know that the two proteins associate with each other in vivo and are co-localised by the domains on the outside of the membrane. However when we just mix the two kinase domains we don’t see a strong enough association to allow a complex to be purified. We know from in-vitro tests such as the phosphorylation tests I’ve mentioned previously that there must at least be transient contact to allow phosphorylation but that isn’t sufficient to set up crystal plates of the complex.</p>
<p>One way to try and get around this is to artificially tether the two kinase domains together with a flexible loop. I have a construct which does exactly this, tethering one end of ACVR2 to ALK2. It’s known as QQ02ACVR2A. I purified this protein and then formed a complex with the binding partner FKBP12 which will bind to the GS domain of ALK2 present in the construct.</p>
<p>The first test during purification was to see if a complex could be assembled between the fusion construct and FKBP12. As they are very differences sizes (72 kDa vs. 12 kDa) purification by gel filtration gives a very clear answer. We can clearly see co-elution of the fusion and FKBP12 which is only possible if they were present as a complex. This in its self is quite exciting as it shows the fusion is still able to bind to its physiological binding partner.</p>
<p>The second stage after purification is to attempt to crystallise the complex. I concentrated the purified protein down and added compound K02288. K02288 definitely binds ALK2 and has some affinity for ACVR2 which is necessary for stabilising both kinase domains sufficiently to crystallise. I’ve tried crystallising ALK2 alone without compound before and had zero success so it was important to add a compound to this crystallisation attempt.</p>
<p>I set up four coarse screen plates and got the following in the HCS screen:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2262" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/initial_crystals-300x286.png" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/initial_crystals-300x286.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/initial_crystals.png 598w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>B6: 20% PEG8000, 0.2M Mg Acetate, 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5</p>
<p>A7: 1.4M Na Acetate, 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5</p>
<p>A8: 30% 2-propanol, 0.2M Na Citrate tribasic, 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5</p>
<p>These are crystalline but not crystals so I designed a follow up screen based around these conditions. I then used what was left of my complex to set up two plates in this followup screen at 4C and 20C.</p>
<p>After 7 days I found the following in my plates:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2263" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-1024x633.png" alt="" width="780" height="482" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-1024x633.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-300x185.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals-768x475.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FU_xtals.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>I mounted five examples and sent them to the synchrotron. Alas they all came back as either salt or no diffraction. While the salt must be ignored, it’s possible that the no diffraction crystals are protein but just do not diffract. The next step will be to make seed stocks from these wells, purify more protein and set up some more plates to see if I can get any better crystals.</p>
<p>You can find more details <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2276755">over at Zenodo.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m off for Christmas the middle of next week but in the new year I&#8217;ll be trying again at crystallising a variety of different proteins and compounds as well as working on characterising the phospho-mutants of ALK2 I posted about last time. Have a great holiday!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week one of the things I’ve been working on is the final set of mutations in the GS domain of Alk2 to help us unpick the influence of phosphorylation on function.</p>
<p>That, however, is a bit of a mouthful so let’s unpack it a bit.</p>
<p>I said in my last blog post that we know that for Alk2 to phosphorylate SMAD1 it must contain the GS domain. This is a short glycine and serine rich loop of the protein that comes before the main kinase domain. The serine residues in this region can be phosphorylated and this seems to be key to activating Alk2. The pattern of phosphorylation of these residues may well be important and split in specific ways between auto phosphorylation and trans phosphorylation by a type II receptor.</p>
<p>In order to work out which phosphorylation’s are key for SMAD activation, we designed mutants that would change the serine residues (where phosphorylation occurs) to alanine residues, thus preventing phosphorylation on that residue. In different combinations this allows us to test which phosphorylations are key to activation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2177" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Phos_mutation-1024x375.png" alt="" width="780" height="286" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Phos_mutation-1024x375.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Phos_mutation-300x110.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Phos_mutation-768x281.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Mutations in the GS domain (blue) of Alk2, immediately prior to the kinase domain (green). The table shows the 11 different mutants that probe the different combinations of phosphorylation events necessary for SMAD1 activation. Row 11 in yellow is the mutant recently cloned.</em></p>
<p>My colleague George Kerr designed and cloned most of the constructs but moved onto a new role before the final one was made. I’ve now tried to make the final clone (highlighted in yellow) based on her primer designs.</p>
<p>I got colonies from my cloning and picked four to send for sequencing. Sequencing revealed that all four colonies contained the correct mutation and no additional mutations.</p>
<p>These mutant proteins can now be used to do in-cell assays, used as templates to make constructs suitable for expression and from there used in many of the in-vitro experiments I’ve already described to help work out the influence each of these phosphorylation events has.</p>
<p>For more details on the experimental methods please look at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1495120">Zenodo here.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions to be asked when looking at the mutation in ALK2 that causes FOP, is how exactly does that mutation cause the disease. ALK2 we know is part of the BMP signalling pathway responsible for bone formation and the mutation results in excess bone formation – thus we can summarise that somehow the mutation leads to increased signal. The question is how?</p>
<p>Alk2 is known to phosphorylate SMADs 1, 5 and 8 (summarised as SMAD1/5/8) in order to signal downstream in the BMP signalling pathway. The instigation of this signal comes from the binding of an external BMP ligand to the domains of Alk2 and a type II receptor on the outside of the cell. This co-locates the internal domains (which incidentally is also where the Alk2 mutation is located) and seems to drive signalling.</p>
<p>I have been looking at the activation of SMAD1 by ALK2 in the presence or absence of a Type II receptor and in the presence or absence of the FOP ALK2 mutation. The activation of SMAD1 results in its phosphorylation which can be monitored by mass spectrometry.</p>
<ul>
<li>We know from previous experiments that Alk2 alone cannot activate SMAD1 even if the mutation is present, thus the Type II receptor is needed.</li>
<li>We know that Type II activity isn’t necessary for SMAD1 activation as using a kinase dead version of BMPR2 still works.</li>
<li>We know from previous experiments that you need both the kinase and GS domains of Alk2 in order to get SMAD1 activation.</li>
<li>We know from previous experiments that BMPR2 and ACVR2 both work to allow SMAD1 activation.</li>
<li>We know that Alk2 autophosphorylates its self to some degree, focused on the GS loop.</li>
<li>We know that the type II receptor transphosphorylates Alk2 adding additional phosphorylation sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2116" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Receptor_interactions-190x300.png" alt="" width="190" height="300" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Receptor_interactions-190x300.png 190w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Receptor_interactions.png 543w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" /></p>
<p>Interaction of the type I and type II receptors in the membrane.</p>
<p>So what don’t we know?</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t know how the mutation in Alk2 effects the rate of SMAD1 phosphorylation</li>
<li>We don’t know how transphosphorylation effects the rate of SMAD1 phosphorylation.</li>
<li>We don’t’ know how the mutation effects the rate of autophosphorylation of Alk2.</li>
</ul>
<p>This experiment can be performed using isolated purified proteins. I’ve been busy purifying Alk2 (wild type and two mutant versions – Q207E and R206H), ACVR2 and BMPR2. I’m now ready to combine these with samples of the Kinase Dead version of BMPR2 and SMAD1 that I have in the freezer into a mass spec based assay.</p>
<p>I mixed all the components together at appropriate concentrations, in this case all proteins were at 40uM, ATP was at 0.5mM, Magnesium ions were at 5mM, Manganese ions were at 2mM and DTT (a reducing agent to stop the proteins precipitating) was at 5mM. These concentrations are needed because if you drop lower, you lose the association between the type I and II receptors. In the cell they’d be brought together in the membrane by a ligand binding outside the cell which would co-locate the inner domains. Since we’re only looking at the inner domains in vitro, we need to artificially increase the concentrations to allow them to interact. 40uM was previously determined as being the lowest concentration at which this interaction can reliably be measured.</p>
<p>Once the ATP had been added, this started the phosphorylation reaction. I took a small sample at various time points (30s, 1min, 90s, 2min, 150s, 3min, 4min, 5min, 6min, 7min, 8min, 9min, 10min, 15min, 20min 25min) from my main reaction mix, and acid quenched the reaction in this sample to stop it going any further. This was done by diluting the sample in mass spectrometry running buffer containing 0.1% formic acid.</p>
<p>The samples were run overnight on the mass spectrometry machine to measure the mass of each of the proteins and the masses of any phosphorylated proteins. The peak heights for each of the phosphorylated states (I looked at up to 2 phosphorylation states for SMAD1 and 8 for Alk2) was extracted from the data and used to monitor the rate of phosphorylation of both Alk2 and SMAD1 over time.</p>

<p><em>Total phosphorylation of Q207E after 25 minutes incubation with ACVR2.</em></p>
<p>I used the following combination of proteins in my reaction mixes:</p>
<table style="width: 510px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 141px;">&nbsp;</td>
<td style="width: 88px;">ACVR2 active</td>
<td style="width: 93px;">BMPR2 active</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This gave me the following results: In each case the important bit to look at is the initial slope of the reaction, not the absolute magnitude as that is more subject to Mass Spec variance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interpreting this data is quite tricky because you can look at phosphorylation on either protein while at the same time comparing the effects of the Alk2 mutations or you can compare the effects of the different type II receptors. I haven’t got enough data to be able to get any quantitative data on initial rates of reaction but the trends shown in this experiment match the trends seen in the previous experiment I ran of this type some time ago (before I started writing this blog).</p>
<p>So, what can we conclude from this experiment?</p>
<ul>
<li>SMAD1 phosphorylation is slower with wild type Alk2 than with either of the mutations (levels out at 20 minutes compared to 5 minutes aprox.)</li>
<li>When looking at SMAD1 phosphorylation, BMPR2 is a less good companion than ACVR2 when wild type Alk2 is used. Q207E somewhat counteracts this effect and R206H has the most pronounced counteraction bringing the rate of phosphorylation with BMPR2 to nearly equivalent to ACVR2.</li>
<li>In general the Q207E mutation is a greater facilitator of SMAD1 phosphorylation than wild type. The R206H mutation is better than both of them.</li>
<li>The rate of ALK2 phosphorylation is not effected by the type II protein used.</li>
<li>The rate of Alk2 phosphorylation does change depending on which construct is used. WT has the lowest rate, Q207E has a faster rate while R206H has the fastest rate.</li>
<li>The kinase dead version of BMPR2 leads to minimal difference in Alk2 phosphorylation but does reduce SMAD1 phosphorylation when compared to the BMPR2.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next step: Try and repeat it again, however for that I need more wild type protein and we still don’t have the expression system back up and running for that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Structure Solution for BMPR1B/FKBP12 complex bound to M4K2009.</p>
<p>Good news everybody!</p>
<p>From the crystals I sent to the Diamond Light Source (a synchrotron, or particle accelerator, that gives very high quality x-rays) last week, I got a data set for BMPR1B/FKBP12 with M4K2009 bound to it! This is one of the compounds that the M4K Pharma company is very keen to see in situ to understand it&#8217;s action. While it would ideally be bound to ALK2 (something Ros is working on), seeing it bound to BMPR1B is also useful for understanding it&#8217;s selectivity (or lack of it) across various BMP signalling proteins.</p>
<p>The data looks like it refines down to around 2.34 Å. I’ve then spent much of last week analysing the data and trying to get a decent model of the proteins.</p>
<p>The data is in the P1 21 1 crystal form (this is just a way of describing the symmetry within the crystal) and has two copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit (which is another way of defining how the protein is packed inside the crystal). It’s refining nicely and I’ve got a very nice clear look at the compound bound to the binding site however I also noticed that several (but not all) exposed cysteines have been covalently modified by something in the plate well condition to give very distinct blobs of electron density that need to be identified.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1948" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compound_density-1024x739.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="563" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compound_density-1024x739.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compound_density-300x217.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compound_density-768x555.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compound_density.jpg 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><em>Compound M4K2009 bound to BMPR1B.</em></p>
<p>Looking back, the crystal was grown in 20% PEG8000, 0.2M Magnesium Acetate and 0.1M Cacodylate pH6.5.  Under these conditions it’s most likely that the cacodylate has reacted with the cys residue, most likely catalysed by neighbouring side chains deprotonating the SH group and allowing it to react with the arsenic at the centre of Cacodylate. However, there are two possible reactions that could occur, one of which leaves you with a sulphur bound to an arsenic with two methyl groups and an oxygen attached to it, and the other which leaves you with just two methyl groups bound to the arsenic. Now – consulting with my chemist colleagues they believe that the oxygen containing result is most likely and I’m inclined to agree as it is the simplest and most easily catalysed reaction. However, looking at the density and modelling in both options, it looks like the second might fit better. Either there is a more complex reaction occurring or it’s possible the oxygen has been knocked off by radiation damage during data collection.</p>
<p>Currently I’ve modeled them all as the second option since as a general rule what the data is telling you should win out over the prediction, but I can relatively easily change that if necessary. I need to get a second opinion on it at some point and any thoughts are greatly received.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1949" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cacodylate_modification.png" alt="" width="311" height="125" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cacodylate_modification.png 311w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cacodylate_modification-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /></p>
<p><em>Two possible options of cacodylate modification to cys residues.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, none of the cys residues are near the binding site however so this isn’t an issue that is going to effect that result and I can be fairly confident that compound binding is not influenced by it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a couple of weeks off over August but I was back last week ready to crack on with work.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably been following the ongoing saga, Ros and I have been struggling with expression of our key constructs. She had some good news on that on her latest post which has some protein from a small scale test expression that we looked at. We each did one ‘set’ of purifications from a small scale grow-up that was testing different virus loads, and compared our results. This was an excellent check that one of us wasn’t doing something odd that was messing things up &#8211; since we both came up with the same results (there was expression and a low load of virus gave the highest yield) this was enormously reassuring. Fingers crossed for the scale up!</p>
<p>In the meantime I’ve been purifying some other proteins to work with which, while not Alk2 are similar in structure. If we can crystallise some of the M4KPharma compounds with them they may give insights as to how these compounds would bind to Alk2 even if we currently can’t get any Alk2 crystal structures with them.</p>
<p>The three proteins I purified were ACVR2 (the type II partner to Alk2), Alk3 (Also known as BMPR1A) and Alk6 (a.k.a. BMPR1B).  Details on the purification can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1404977">here on zenodo</a>.</p>

<p>The purifications went well, and I had expression from all three proteins. This is better than last time I tried to purify Alk3 and Alk6 where I had no expression. The only slight problem I had was an incomplete cleavage of ACVR2 with Tev so I did a nickle rebind to separate out the tagged and the untagged protein. In this case I managed to get the tagged protein pure enough to use in crystal plates.</p>

<p>I set up crystal plates with ACVR2 and three M4KPharma compounds (M4K2009, M4K3003 and M4K3007) and froze the Alk3 and Alk6 for future use. Both Alk3 and Alk6 constructs have the GS domain that requires FKBP12 for stabilisation and crystallisation. Since I didn’t have any FKBP12 to hand, I flash froze them and put them in the -80°C freezer for future use.</p>
<p>As of the four day inspection I have no crystals of ACVR2 but a couple of drops of interest that might be of use either for follow-up screens or that might develop into crystals in the coming days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of an ongoing collaboration with Meds4Kids Pharma (M4KPharma), we are testing a range of compounds identified and generated by them as being of interest in developing a molecule specific against ALK2 that has the right properties help treat some cases of DIPG. This also has significant implications for development of a drug that might help in FOP which also involves the dysregulation of ALK2.</p>
<p>Ros and I have been trying to crystallise some of the more interesting compounds from M4KPharma but we’ve run into a few problems. There are two constructs we use predominantly for crystallisation of new compounds as they have been shown to be robust and relatively well crystallisable. These constructs are of the kinase plus GS domain which we use in complex with FKBP12, and the kinase domain only which we use on its own. Both are expressed in insect cells and usually give a good robust expression that allows multiple compounds to be set up in crystal plates and significant chemical space explored from a single 2L purification. For the past couple of months our insect cells expressions have been failing to give us any expression of these two constructs which has made setting up crystal plates in high throughput impossible. Ros and I have been working with our Biotech team who are in charge of our baculo production facility to try and troubleshoot why this is the case; we’ve looked at whether the flasks have changed (they haven’t), the media has changed (it hasn’t), the virus has gone off and whether going back to an earlier virus stock might help (it didn’t). Currently I’ve got a pellet of the kinase+GS domain to look at, which was generated from a plate of revived constructs where the bacmids were recloned from very early in the pipeline. The cells were grown for 72h and harvested at 900g for 20 minutes. Hopefully that will have done the trick and we’ll have recovered the expression of our most useful ALK2 construct.</p>
<p>However, in the meantime these compounds still need investigating so I’ve been looking at crystallising three compounds (M4K2009, M4K3003 and M4K3007) with a construct of ALK2 which covers the kinase domain, the GS domain and contains the R206H mutation.</p>
<p>The purification went well and I managed to get enough from the prep to make up 12 plates – 4 plates for each of the compounds I’m looking at. Because the construct contains the GS domain, it is likely to require FKBP12 to stabilise it sufficiently to crystallise. Ros had some spare purified FKBP12 in the fridge which I could use for the complex. However, given the R206H mutation, the affinity for FKBP12 is decreased (but not eliminated – as you can see in panel A of figure 2 below) and means that the complex cannot be purified well by gel filtration.</p>

<p>Instead the proteins were mixed at a 1:1 ratio prior to having the compound added and set up in crystal trays. Four course screens were used (JCSG7, LFS6, HCS3, and HIN3) which sample a wide range of chemical space. JCSG7 and LFS6 were incubated at 20C while HCS3 and HIN3 were incubated at 4C.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Fig. 2     A: Previous analytical gel filtration experiments show that the complexing of FKBP12 to ALK2 (wt) lead to a shift of 0.25ml suggesting a complex has been formed.

<p>After 24h there are a couple of interesting drops that seem to have some crystalline matter in them which I will be watching with interest to see if they grow. I’m away next week so hopefully there will be something to see when I get back!</p>

<p>It’s been a very busy few weeks, a fair amount of lab work but also a fair bit of outreach work (which is the other part of my job) and so I’ve sadly neglected to write my poor blog post. However,  now I’ve got the chance to write a bit about what I’ve been up to.</p>
<p>Previously I’d talked about how using a pulldown it looked like ACVR2 was being pulled down in complex with XIAP. To explore this further I attempted to purify the complex of ACVR2 with XIAP using protein I had already purified.</p>
<p>First I had to remove the GST tag from XIAP which I did by incubating with Tev protease overnight. Then I had to purify the XIAP from the GST tag and the uncleaved protein.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1595" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ni_rebind-145x300.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="300" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ni_rebind-145x300.jpg 145w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ni_rebind.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px" /></p>
<p><strong>A mix of cleaved and uncleaved can be seen in the initial sample (init) and in the final elution (E) while only a strong lower band for XIAP alone is seen in flow through (FT) and wash (W)</strong></p>
<p>I mixed ACVR2 with excess XIAP and ran it down a size exclusion column. However it appears that the two proteins do not have a high enough affinity to be co-purified in this fashion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1593" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/complex_purification-793x1024.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="1007" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/complex_purification-793x1024.jpg 793w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/complex_purification-232x300.jpg 232w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/complex_purification-768x992.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/complex_purification.jpg 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><strong>Top: SDS-PAGE of GF75 size exclusion run showing no complex formation between XIAP and ACVR2. Bottom: Corresponding UV trace from the AKTA </strong></p>
<p>Instead I mixed the proteins at a 1:1 ratio, concentrated them down, added 0.5mM LDN-193189 and set up crystal plates using four coarse screens at both 4°C and 20°C.</p>
<p>I found two crystals which I mounted but neither of them were very promising. I sent them on the next available trip to the Diamond light source and neither of them diffracted.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1594" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/diamond_xx03acvr2a.jpg" alt="" width="1952" height="796" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/diamond_xx03acvr2a.jpg 1952w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/diamond_xx03acvr2a-300x122.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/diamond_xx03acvr2a-768x313.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/diamond_xx03acvr2a-1024x418.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1952px) 100vw, 1952px" /></p>
<p><strong>Crystal drops, mounted crystals and diamond screening data for ACVR2/XIAP complex.</strong></p>
<p>So… back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>The next step is to try some different constructs of XIAP as the one I used was just one domain. I’ve obtained a plasmid for a full length XIAP-GST tagged construct from a collaborating lab which I have transformed into both MACH1 and BL21-DE3 cells and expressed 6l in LB from the BL21-DE3 stock ready for purification. The collaborator also has other constructs of XIAP with different domains that we can try after trying the full length to try and narrow down which domain (if any) interact with the Type I and Type II protein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
