								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Grin1 </em></strong><strong>p.Tyr647Ser Project</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background. </strong><em>Grin </em>genes across species encode for proteins that make up the different NMDA receptor subunits. <em>GRIN1 </em>mutations (usually heterozygous) are associated with intellectual disability with epilepsy in humans, including the rare p.Tyr647Ser (Y647S) variant. This missense mutation occurs in the M3 helix of the transmembrane domain of <em>GRIN1 </em>which, importantly, is conserved between human <em>GRIN1 </em>and mouse <em>Grin1</em>. Currently, no effective pharmacological intervention or gene therapy exists to treat human patients with <em>GRIN1 </em>disorders. Patients with different variants to the <em>GRIN1</em>gene vary widely in symptom presentation. Thus, it is imperative to independently study each of the variants preclinically when developing treatments.</p>
<p>To do this, we generated <em>Grin1<sup>Y647S </sup></em>mice using CRISPR and bred founder mice to develop F1  <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>progeny. As proof-of-concept for our study, our first aim is to evaluate the behaviour of <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>mice to ascertain whether there is phenotypic similarity to <em>GRIN1 </em>Y647S patients.</p>
<p>This entry describes <strong>pilot results </strong>from the Ramsey Laboratory regarding behavioural consequences of heterozygous Y647S mutation in mice.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioural Assays, Results, and Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>Each graph contains data from <em>n</em>= 4 WT and <em>n =</em>4 <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>mice of &gt;12 weeks of age mixed sexes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Field Test</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To measure locomotor activity.</em>Mice were placed in plexiglass arenas of 20x20x45 cm and their locomotor activity was measured using digital activity monitoring of infrared light beam breaks for 2h in 5min bins:</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Social Affiliative Assay</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To measure social behaviour. </em>Mice were placed in an opaque open-top arena of 62x42x22 cm containing two wire cups. One wire cup contained a novel, same-age, same-sex mouse as a social stimulus, while the other cup was empty. Mice were allowed to freely explore the arena for 8min and their activity was measured using video recording motion software. The time spent in the 3cm zone surrounding each cup was recorded, as well as the track length each mouse accumulated around each cup, and the number of visits they made to each cup.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Elevated Plus Maze</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To measure anxiety-like behaviour.</em>Mice were placed in a elevated maze (39 cm high) composed of two opposing open arms (30.5&#215;5 cm) and two opposing closed arms (30.5x5x15.2 cm). Mice were placed in an open arm of the maze and allowed to freely explore for 8 min in dim light while being recorded. Motion tracking software measured the amount of time spent in open and closed arms.</p>

<p><strong>Other observations.</strong> I report that 1 male and 1 female <em>Grin1<sup>+/Y647S </sup></em>mouse each displayed a seizure when placed on the elevated plus maze. I would describe this seizure as atonic-like in nature: while mice stood on their hind legs, I observed rapid chewing movements, light convusions, and they fell to the floor of the EPM. Seizures lasted ~10s and mice rapidly regained consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Planned experiments. </strong>Future experiments will involve boosting behaviour experimental group numbers, and examining biochemical consequences of Y647S on overall NMDA receptor function in order to determine treatment strategies for <em>GRIN1</em>patients.</p>
