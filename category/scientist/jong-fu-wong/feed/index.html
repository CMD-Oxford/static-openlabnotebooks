				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I have been characterising the cellular potency of many M4K compounds against ALK2 and ALK5. Compounds that targets ALK2 and not ALK5 should be further evaluated for their ability to reduce the viability of cells derived from DIPG patients. Although these cultured cells might not reflect what actually happens in a DIPG patient&#8217;s brain, it is the the best tool we have on hand.</p>
<p>Viability assay using Celltiter Glo kit has been chosen as the main method for evaluating the efficacy of ALK2 inhibitors on DIPG patient-derived cells due to its robustness (refer to my previous post for how I determined this). As a pilot experiment, 8 ALK2 inhibitors with differing potencies were chosen and evaluated in 3 DIPG patient-derived cell lines (one with wild-type ALK2 and two with mutant ALK2).</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p>
<p>DIPG cells will be seeded into wells coated with laminin at densities optimised in previous experiments. After allowing the cells to adhere overnight, they will be treated with serial dilutions of various M4K compounds. After 7 days of compound treatment, the area occupied by the cells, the intensity of propidium iodide signal and Celltiter Glo luminescence signal will be determined.</p>

<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>1) HSJD-DIPG-007 was sensitive toward most of the M4K compounds.</p>
<p>2) SU-DIPG-IV was not sensitive to most of the compounds.</p>
<p>3) M4K3003 and M4K3007 which were based on patent literature were not efficacious despite having decent potency towards ALK2.</p>
<p>4) M4K2009 was reduced the viability of DIPG lines with ALK2 mutation while M4K2163 showed efficacy in all of the DIPG cell lines.</p>
<p><strong>In a nut shell:</strong></p>
<p>More compounds still needs to be evaluated in more DIPG patient-derived cell lines in order to better establish relationship between ALK2 IC50, compound chemical structure and efficacy in reducing the viability of DIPG cells.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation of the efficacy of M4K compounds in DIPG patient-derived cell lines is essential before any promising compounds can be further tested in mouse xenograft models. This approach can aid in narrowing down clinical compound candidates and reduce the time, resources and animal sacrifice needed downstream.</p>
<p>A robust and efficient readout for the changes in the viability of the DIPG cells needs to be established before it can be used to evaluate the M4K compounds. In addition, the amount of cells to be seeded at the beginning of the experiment has to be optimised to avoid overcrowding and starvation of the cells after extended culture times. Overcrowding and starvation will lead to increased cell death and prevent accurate estimation of the potency of M4K compounds (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC50">EC50</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p>
<p>The wells of 96-well plate with transparent bottom will be coated with laminin to synchronise the mode of growth (adherent or non-adherent) among the different patient-derived lines. Additionally, this will promote even distribution of cells and allow most cells to be in focus when images are taken.</p>
<p>An increasing cell number (125 to 20000) will be seeded into each well. The amount of cells after 7 days of growth in 100µl of medium will be measured based on the area occupied and the total amount of ATP present in each well. In addition, propidium iodide which stains dead cells will be added at the beginning the experiment. At seeding number that are not saturating, the amount of cells after 7 days should remain proportional to the initial seeding number.</p>

<p>3) CellTiter Glo signal and confluency are good indicators of the actual quantity of cells in the well. Below 5000 cells seeded per well, both sets of measurements correlated almost perfectly with each other.</p>
<p>4) Cell death (as indicated by propidium iodide signal) in relation to total cell at endpoint increases when too many cells were seeded at the beginning of the experiment.</p>
<p>5) Initial cell seeding numbers for each patient-derived cell lines that do not lead to overcrowding at the end of the experiment can be chosen based on the linearity of CellTiter Glo signal and the intensity of propidium iodide.</p>

<p>We now have the parameters to go ahead and evaluate how well M4K compounds can stop the growth or kill DIPG cells.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Special thanks to:</strong></p>
<p>David Drewry – Helped with designing the nanoBRET tracers</p>
<p>M4K pharma OICR chemist team – Synthesised the M4K1046-linker derivatives</p>
<p>Carrow Wells (UNC) – Conjugated the M4K1046 to nanoBRET fluorophore</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I have always wanted to establish nanoBRET target engagement assay for ALK5. Relative to dual luciferase promoter assay and immunofluorescent staining, nanoBRET is many times faster. With a robust ALK5 nanoBRET assay, I will be able to rapidly screen for cellular off-target activity.</p>
<p>Since none of the commercial nanoBRET tracers worked with ALK5, we attempted to generate our own tracers. We chose to create these bespoke tracers based on M4K1046 because it has cellular IC50 of ~50nM for ALK5. David Drewry has helped to design linkers that will attach fluorophores (nanoBRET energy acceptor) to the solvent-facing end of M4K1046. Based on known structures, additional bulk in this region should not hinder the binding of the compounds to ALK5. Two versions of M4K1046 (with different linker length) were synthesised by the M4K pharma chemist team in OICR. They were subsequently sent to Carrow Wells for conjugation to nanoBRET fluorophore.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to determine the binding of these tracers to ALK5-nanoluciferase fusion. Therefore, I incubated increasing concentrations of tracer with HEK293 cells expressing ALK5-nanoluciferase fusion protein. If the tracers can bind nicely to the ATP pocket of ALK5, incubation with increasing concentrations of tracer will result in increasing BRET signal (wavelength = 610 nm). The resulting magnitude of BRET and EC50 estimated from the curve are good indicators to whether these tracers can be used for nanoBRET assay with ALK5.</p>
<p>To identify any background signal, I have included a replicate of the above experiment with 10,000nM of parent M4K1046. These unlabelled compound will saturate ALK5 ATP pockets and prevent the binding of nanoBRET tracers. All signal from this set of experiment is contributed by non-specific background.</p>
<p>To be eliminate doubts of any technical or reagent issues with the nanoBRET experiment itself, I have replicated both experiments above, substituting ALK5 with ALK2.</p>

<div id="attachment_2693" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-2693" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fig-3.png" alt="" width="570" height="301" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fig-3.png 555w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fig-3-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">EC50 curves of the second bespoke ALK5 tracer (UNC-CIW-001-012) with ALK2-nanoluc and ALK5-nanoluc.

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Both bespoke tracers cannot be used for ALK5 nanoBRET. Both of them did not bind to ALK5. The nanoBRET experiment itself was a success since both tracers worked well with ALK2 (over 20 folds assay windows). The background noise was low for both tracers. ALK5 seems to intrinsically not tolerate bulky additions on the solvent end of M4K1046. This might be additional avenue for improving ALK2 vs ALK5 selectivity. At the very least, we have gained this additional information from these efforts.</p>

<p>I determined the potency of 24 new ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors synthesised by OICR. M4K2009 in particular is quite potent (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50">larger values indicates lower potency</a>). This compound differs from legacy compound M4K1055 by the position of its methyl group (CH3) in the middle of the molecule. Attempts to replace the tri-methoxy group (the three CH3-O groups bonded to the phenyl ring) were not successful. Since a robust nanoBRET tracer is not available for TGFBR1/ALK5, I will use dual luciferase promoter assay (orthologous assay) to determine the off-target activity of these compounds towards TGFBR1/ALK5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large number of ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors were previously synthesised by Paul Brenner’s team (Target Discovery Center, University of Oxford) for the purpose of treating Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP). Although these compounds were not designed with blood-brain-barrier permeability in mind, they can serve as good bench-marks for my cellular assays. Therefore, 30 of these legacy compounds were chosen to be tested before other new bespoke Diffused Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) compounds from Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) and Charles River Laboratories (CRL). Inhibition of TGFBR1/ALK5 leads to cardiac toxicity. Since I have not yet been able to establish a robust nanoBRET target engagement assay for TGFBR1/ALK5, I will have to resort to dual luciferase promoter assay (orthologous assay) for the time being.</p>

<p>The off-target ALK5 inhibition by most of the legacy ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors are not high. Only a handful of legacy compounds had ALK5 IC50 &lt;1000nM (M4K1062, M4K1134, M4K1212 and M4K1046). Among them M4K1046 has an ALK5 IC50 of 63nM. This shows that the legacy compounds designed for FOP treatment had been well designed to minimise the risk of cardiac toxicity. However, in all cases, potency towards ALK2 and ALK5 appeared to be coupled. Differentially increasing the potency towards ALK2 while minimising ALK5 potency is highly desirable for future M4K designs. More careful analysis of the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) of these legacy compounds is necessary to draw useful lessons for new M4K compound design.</p>

<p>Some of the legacy ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitors are very potent (M4K1062, M4K1210, M4K 1187, M4K1134, M4K1139, M4K1212, M4K1216, M4K1046). However, their off-target activity towards TGFBR1/ALK5 still needed to be determined. Inhibition of TGFBR1/ALK5 leads to cardiac toxicity. Since I have not yet been able to establish a robust nanoBRET target engagement assay for TGFBR1/ALK5, I will have to resort to <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/project-overview-establishing-cellular-assays-to-screen-for-alk2-inhibitors/">dual luciferase promoter assay (orthologous assay)</a> for the time being.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EC50 of Tracer-6908 with ACVR1-c-nanoLuc and ideal conditions for the target engagement assay have been determined in <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/determining-the-ec50-of-tracer-6908-with-acvr1-alk2-nanoluc/">a previous experiment</a>. However, it is still necessary to verify that the IC50 values determined in the assay are closed enough approximation to the actual IC50 values of the compounds. If the IC50 values are strongly influenced by the concentration of Tracer-6908 used, multiple assays with progressively lower Tracer-6908 will need to be performed. The actual IC50 of the compounds can then be estimated by plotting the Tracer-6908 concentrations against the corresponding IC50 values and regressing to no Tracer-6908. To address this, multiple nanoBRET target engagement assays were setup with increasing concentrations of Tracer-6908 with the same serial dilution of M4K1962 (starting from the EC50 of 65nM).</p>

<p>Good news! The IC50 values determined using low concentrations of Tracer-6908 are good approximation of the actual compound IC50. 65nM Tracer-6908 is chosen for future nanoBRET ACVR1/ALK2 assays because it will be most cost efficient. Even though the maximum signal at this tracer concentration is lower, the standard deviation among experimental replicates remained small, indicating that the quality of the data is not compromised.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In nano<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer#BRET">BRET</a> assay, a fluorescently labelled tracer binds to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP-binding_motif">ATP-binding pocket</a> of ACVR1/ALK2. This binding brings the tracer into the proximity (&lt;10nm) of <a href="https://www.promega.com/~/media/files/promega%20worldwide/europe/promega%20uk/webinars%20and%20events/cell%20analysis%20seminar%20tour/terry-riss-02.pdf">Nano-Luciferase</a> which is fused to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus">C-terminus</a> of ACVR1/ALK2. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) occurs where the energy released by Nano-Luciferase is transferred to the fluorophore via intermolecular forces. Nano-Luciferase and tracer emit light at 460nm and 610nm respectively. The amount of tracer bound to ACVR1/ALK2 will be proportional to BRET signal (610nm light). The direct engagement of compound molecules to ACVR1/ALK2 can be determined from the reduction in BRET signal.</p>
<p>Matt Robers and Jim Vasta from Promega had provided us with Tracer-6908 that was developed collaboratively with SGC. Before the tracer can be used in nanoBRET assay for compound IC50, it is necessary to determine the optimal tracer concentration. The tracer concentration needs to be sufficient to produce adequate BRET signal while at the same time low enough to not obscure the competition by test compounds.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the EC50 of Tracer-6908 with ACVR1/ALK2-c-nanoLuc differs depending on the microplate used and assay volume. In the future, assay condition must be unified for the results to be comparable between compounds tested.</p>
<div id="attachment_1284" style="width: 855px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-1284" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/EC50-of-Tracer-6908-for-ACVR1-luc-300x186.png" alt="" width="845" height="524" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/EC50-of-Tracer-6908-for-ACVR1-luc-300x186.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/EC50-of-Tracer-6908-for-ACVR1-luc-768x475.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/EC50-of-Tracer-6908-for-ACVR1-luc.png 861w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The condition and assay volume chosen for future compound tests is bracketed in red</p></div>
<p>Another practical lesson learned is that care must be taken when acquiring BRET measurements with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture">aperture</a> “spoon” installed on the reader machine. The 96-well microplate BRET measurements acquired with 384-well aperture “spoon” contained large standard deviation. Removal of the aperture “spoon” drastically reduced the standard deviation, with minimal change to the EC50 value estimated from the curve.</p>
<div id="attachment_1285" style="width: 532px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-1285" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pherastar-FSX-Aperture-Should-be-Removed-for-NanoBRET-300x135.png" alt="" width="522" height="235" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pherastar-FSX-Aperture-Should-be-Removed-for-NanoBRET-300x135.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pherastar-FSX-Aperture-Should-be-Removed-for-NanoBRET-768x344.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pherastar-FSX-Aperture-Should-be-Removed-for-NanoBRET.png 814w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Blotting out signal unnecessarily might result in large standard deviations</p></div>
<p>From this experiment, 20ul assay volume in 384-well polypropylene microplate was chosen for ACVR1/ALK2 nanoBRET assays in the future because it will be most cost efficient <strong>(I am cutting the cost approximately from £45 to £10 per compound per assay!)</strong>. In this setting, the EC50 of Tracer-6908 is 65nM.</p>
