										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></a><strong>Production and purification of Ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein</strong><br />
      Two different expression plasmids for prefusion S ectodomain residues 1−1208 of 2019-nCoV S (GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions (2P) at residues 986 and 987(1) and with six proline substitutions (HexaPro (at residues 817, 892, 899, 942, 986 and 987 (2), a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag in the mammalian expression vector pαH were generously gifted by Dr.McLellan’s lab (1,2). </p>
<p>I. Production and purification of the 2P version of S-Ectodomain.<br />
During the first purifications from a small-scale production we have faced some challenges with the 2P version of this protein. (Figure 1.) </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1as.png" alt="" width="1032" height="575" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5354" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1as.png 1032w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1as-300x167.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1as-1024x571.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1as-768x428.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p>
<p>Purification from a big scale-up production using another buffer (1x PBS) led to the same problems, and we evaluated protein concentrations by Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Please see Figure 2&#038;3) and comparative gel analysis. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-2.png" alt="" width="1088" height="612" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5362" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-2.png 1088w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-2-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-2-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-3.-as.png" alt="" width="1105" height="622" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5368" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-3.-as.png 1105w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-3.-as-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-3.-as-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-3.-as-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1105px) 100vw, 1105px" /></p>
<p>We have obtained total 12mg of Histag purified and dialyzed protein and run 9mg of protein  on the size-exclusion column. SEC profiles showed that a big portion of the protein were in aggregates (Figure 4).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-4.-AS.png" alt="" width="1116" height="628" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5364" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-4.-AS.png 1116w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-4.-AS-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-4.-AS-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-4.-AS-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1116px) 100vw, 1116px" /></p>
<p>On the size-exclusion profile we observed 2 peaks of the aggregates and collected only a 3rd peak corresponding to the trimer of S- Ectodomain running close to 670kD.<br />
Based on the results of the purifications by affinity, size-exclusion protocols and exchanging notes with a Biotechnology group of SGC Oxford, we’ve come to conclusions that S- Ectodomain is prone to the aggregation almost at the every stage of purification, one nucleation of the aggregates “ curls up” a most part of the protein.<br />
We have optimised a few steps in the production and purification of this target to prevent or minimize aggregation:<br />
• Cultured cells were harvested in a different hours of the post-transfection times<br />
• Harvested culture supernatant clarified by two steps of centrifugation at RT was passed through a<br />
  0.22 μm filter before IMAC batch absorption<br />
• After IMAC purification, combined peak fractions were filtered through a 0.22 μm filter, before<br />
  concentrating and loading to the SEC<br />
• Concentrated combined fractions of the eluted protein at 16 degree celsius and  run on SEC<br />
Size-exclusion profiles of S-Ectodomain from these 4 purifications shown no major aggregates and a main fraction of the protein was corresponding to the expected MV as 670kD (Figure 5.), but a final yield of the purified by two-steps protein were very low as 0.2-0.3mg/L.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-5.-AS.png" alt="" width="1035" height="583" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5365" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-5.-AS.png 1035w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-5.-AS-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-5.-AS-1024x577.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-5.-AS-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1035px) 100vw, 1035px" /></p>
<p>We have run protein standards on the SEC column used for this protein to confirm accuracy of the MV of the eluted protein (Figure 6.) </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-6.-as.png" alt="" width="1116" height="628" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5366" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-6.-as.png 1116w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-6.-as-300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-6.-as-1024x576.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-6.-as-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1116px) 100vw, 1116px" /></p>
<p>II. Production and purification of the HexaPro version of S-Ectodomain<br />
We have used the same optimized protocol for the HexaPro version of the S-Ectodomain (Figure 7).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-7.-.png" alt="" width="1101" height="620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5370" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-7.-.png 1101w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-7.--300x169.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-7.--1024x577.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Figure-7.--768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1101px) 100vw, 1101px" /></p>
<p>Final yield for this constructs was higher than for 2P version of S-Ectodomain, we’ve obtained 1mg/L from the first 800ml of production by transient transfection of EXPI293 cells. Further optimization might improve a final yield to the higher expression for this construct, but so far we&#8217;ve done only one production and purification trial with HexaPro. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months, we have all become familiar with the COVID-19 global pandemic. The coronavirus is “decorated” with the Spike (S) protein, one of the 25 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that are encoded in the viral genome.<br />
   The infection starts with the attachment of the virus to the cell membrane to enter host cells.  S- protein mediates infection by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Figure 1).  This interaction occurs when the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S- protein which recognizes and binds ACE2. This interaction mediates membrane fusion and viral entry into human cells.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Covid-image.png" alt="" width="576" height="324" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5216" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Covid-image.png 576w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Covid-image-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>So, it is no wonder why the S-protein, RBD of S-protein and human ACE2 became key targets in Covid-19 related scientific research and in the worldwide collaborative efforts to develop diagnostics such as therapeutic antibodies or a vaccine.</p>
<p>To support the fight against COVID-19 and fulfill the high demand for these proteins, I volunteered, together with my colleague, Ashley Hutchinson to produce and purify high-quality S-protein, RBD and human ACE2 in mammalian cells. It is not a trivial contribution. ACE2 protein, for example, would usually cost hundreds of dollars per ~10 µg. We started this challenging journey back in April, during the lockdown of the city and of the University of Toronto.  Since then, 64 aliquots of our products have been distributed among different labs in Toronto, across Canada and abroad. We are very happy to have feedback from researches indicating that our products are performing well in the projects and in some cases even better than proteins obtained from commercial sources. </p>
<p>Please visit corresponding <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4085730#.X4crSdBKhaQ">Zenodo</a> page for the “Materials and Methods” and details of how we produced and purified these targets to share with the global research community. </p>
