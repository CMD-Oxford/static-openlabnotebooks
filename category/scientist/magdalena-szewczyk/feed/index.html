				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have used the PTMScan<sup>®</sup> Mono-Methyl Arginine Motif [mme-RG] Kit #12235 from CST in order to determine novel PRMT7 substrates. In preliminary experiments done few years ago by our pharma partner several novel potential PRMT7 substrates were discovered with the kit, including HSP70, which was further validated by different methods (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/503136v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/503136v2</a>). In order to obtain biological replicates, recently, we used the same kit. In the initial experiment we followed exactly CST’s protocol ( <a href="https://media.cellsignal.com/pdf/12235.pdf">https://media.cellsignal.com/pdf/12235.pdf</a>) and observed low peptide counts and high background in the IP-ed samples and no presence of our positive control HSP70 peptide FELTGIPPAPR. Since there was some ambiguity about the desalting step in section 5, we had several discussions with CST support. The fruitful discussions compelled us to share a more detailed protocol with the goal of improving the success rates of these enrichments.</p>
<p>In our second attempt, the input or ‘pre-IP’ samples had high counts of HSP70 peptide FELTGIPPAPR, which R is methylated but not heavy labelled in PRMT7 WT and unmethylated in heavy labelled peptide (PRMT7 KO), which is with agreement with our previous findings Fig.1. The HSP70 methylation is visibly detected by anti-Rme1 CST antibody (the same one used in the kit) in western blot, so it should be immunoprecipitated, however the peptide could only be detected in one of the 3 immunoprecipitated samples and at very low counts. We have no idea why it is not working in our hands, but if anyone consider using this kit, I recommend looking at my comments on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3567916#.Xe5D-ehKg2w">zenodo</a> . Good luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My previous results showed that overexpression of HDAC11 decrease basal acetylation levels of exogenous histones as well as decrease the acetylation increase caused by histone acetyltransferases. In order to determine if the observed effect is caused by catalytic activity of HDAC11, I used catalytic HDAC11 mutants Y304H and H142,143A (PIMID: 30819897, 28927261) and published HDAC11 inhibitors SIS17, SIS7 (25 µM, PMID:31264832) and FT895 (5 µM, PMID: 29776742) for validation. I run the assay in different cell lines (HEK293T, Hela and MCF7) with various amounts of HDAC11 and HATs (GCN5, MYST3), various assay duration (1-2 days) and looked at the changes in H3KAc, H3K18Ac, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac levels by western blot.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The results are highly variable mostly due to low signal and effect of HDAC11 overexpression on cell growth (less cells).</li>
<li>In most conditions tested HDAC11 catalytic mutants showed similar decrease in acetylation compared to WT HDAC11.</li>
<li>None of the compounds inhibited the decreased acetylation caused by HDAC11 overexpression. Compound FT895 showed toxic effect even at 5 μM.</li>
<li>The results indicate that the decrease in histone acetylation levels caused by HDAC11 overexpression does not depend on HDAC11 catalytic activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the representative graph form one of the experiments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post I mentioned that there is controversy if HDAC11 can deacetylate histones. I decided to look at the effect of overexpression of HDAC11 on exogenous histone acetylation in cells. In my preliminary results I noticed that exogenous GFP-tagged histones, one day post transfection, have very low levels of acetylation; therefore I decided to add to the system some histone acetyltransferases (p300, GCN5, MYST1, PCAF). My results indicate that overexpression of HDAC11 decrease basal acetylation levels of exogenous histones as well as decrease the acetylation increase caused by histone acetyltransferases. Since we do not know if the observed effect is caused by catalytic activity of HDAC11, I generated catalytic HDAC11 mutants Y304H and H142,143A (previously published PMID:30819897, 28927261), which will be used for validation.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:</strong></p>
<p>HEK293T cells were co-transfected for 20 h in 12 well format with 0.1 µg histone-GFP and:</p>
<p>1.empty vector (0.9 µg)</p>
<p>2.empty vector (0.1 µg) + Hdac11-FLAG (0.8 µg)</p>
<p>3.HAT-FLAG (0.1 µg) + empty vector (0.8 µg)</p>
<p>4.HAT-FLAG (0.1 µg) + Hdac11-FLAG (0.8 µg)</p>
<p><b>Histones:</b> H3, H4, H2A, H2B</p>
<p><b>HATs: </b>MYST1, P300, PCAF, GCN5</p>
<p>Total cell lysates were analysed in western blot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>This is the first time I am going to share with you my research and I will start with the project I am currently working on, which is the development of cellular HDAC11 target engagement assay. HDAC11, the only member of class IV HDAC subfamily, was believed to be responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). However, recent <em>in vitro</em> data indicates that HDAC11 is 10,000 times more efficient in lysine defatty-acylation than deacetylation (Fig1).</p>
<p>Fig1.</p>

<p>Target engagement assays allow us to test if potential  inhibitors enter the cell and interact with a target protein. Here, we are interested in developing this type of assay for HDAC11. Recently, novel potent and cell active HDAC11 inhibitors have been developed, which can be used for cellular assay validation (FT895 and compound 14). (PMID: 29776742). The activity of inhibitors in cells were tested using NanoBRET<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Target Engagement  Assay, which measured the apparent affinity of test compounds by competitive displacement of proprietary compound labeled with a fluorescent tracer reversibly bound to  HDAC11 fused to Nanoluc luciferase. Currently we are in a process of development of our own fluorescent tracer based on published HDAC11 inhibitors and hopefully we will be able to use it for HDAC11 cellular assay development. However, since the tracer is not currently available I had to try other methods. One generic method for confirming target engagement is Cellular Thermal Stability Assays (CETSA) in which binding of the inhibitor increases the thermal stability of the target protein. I tested thermal stability of HDAC11 upon binding to published HDAC11 inhibitors using NanoLuc technology (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937980">29937980</a>). In the assay you are transfecting cells with protein fused to Nanloluc luciferease, treat with inhibitors and measure bioluminescent signal after heat denaturation. Compound binding to the protein should lead to protein stabilization compared to controls. The system can be used in cells, which are not permeabilized and permeabilized with digitonin as a control (Fig2).</p>

<p>In this experiment, I did not observe thermal stabilization of HDAC11-NanoLuc upon compounds FT895 (202) and 14 (201) treatment (Fig3). Experimental assay details are posted on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3267153#.XRyvVetKipo">Zenodo</a>.</p>

<p>Next I am going to test if I can detect any changes in histones acetylation upon HDAC11 overexpression and inhibitors treatment. I will also update you with my effort to develop assay based on two findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>HDAC11 suppresses the thermogenic program of adipose tissue (PMID: 30089714).</li>
<li>HDAC11 regulates the expression of intereukin 10 (PMID: 19011628).</li>
</ol>
