				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well hello there, did you miss me. No, I didn’t get stuck on a <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/the-never-ending-roundabout-of-ipsc-quality-control/">roundabout</a> for days, preventing me from writing my next blog. I was simply enjoying the Montreal sunshine and those umbrella-containing beverages. Whoever came up with the idea of an umbrella in a drink is a genius. The umbrella shades the drink, keeping the ice cold, so you can enjoy the cool refreshing taste of your drink for so longer. It&#8217;s simply &#8220;<em><strong>brilliant</strong></em>&#8220;. All drinks should have umbrellas in my opinion, with little dinosaur pictures or little plastic dinosaurs hanging onto the side. Maybe I will make it my next venture, keep an eye out for jurassic umbrellas.</p>
<p>So we are now at the halfway point since I went and wrote an <a href="https://theconversation.com/to-cure-brain-diseases-neuroscientists-must-collaborate-thats-why-im-giving-my-data-away-118672">article</a> saying I will give away my SOPs and do <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/the-summer-notebook-of-a-principal-investigator/">10 blogs</a> over the summer months. I am now at  Blog #5 of 10, so I kept my promise and did what I said I would do. But I am not finished here, I am only getting started, with more SOPs, data and other exciting goodies coming your way in August and beyond.</p>
<p>Now besides umbrellas another reason for my delay was I got hooked on a new UK show. Can you guess what it is from the title? No, its not “<strong><em>Of dopaminergic neurons</em></strong>”, though that is a new documentary I am developing with the hope of bringing it to TIFF in 2021. I mean &#8220;<em><strong>Years and Years</strong></em>&#8220;. For those not familiar, it follows the Lyons family from Manchester and the series progresses over a 15-year span from 2019 to 2034, tracking how society and our own lives might change with each passing year. It was truly fascinating, and I binged through it in under a week, which is a rare feat for me.</p>
<p>So why do I mention this? Well by looking ahead into the future about what might come, it got me nostalgic and started me thinking about how far things have come with my own stem cell group. Leading me to reminisce for days of yore. When people see our group now, they think we have our stuff together. Which is kind of true, though we do have our own mishaps and disasters from time to time. But, it wasn’t always like that. When we started in 2015, we were an utter gongshow in so many ways, figuring things out on the fly and going day by day. There was me, Carol Chen and Andrea Schreij, with Ted Fon providing us guidance and leadership to keep going. We hadn’t a notion about what we were getting into, we knew stem cells were cool, but the first 6 months were exhausting. Between the three of us we were working 7-day weeks to keep our cells alive and happy. This didn’t even take into account all the effort that went into making neurons from these stem cells. But gradually, with time and perseverance we did it, we made our first dopaminergic neurons, and below is the fluorescence images of these first neurons. This picture is stuck on the door of our cell culture room to remind us of how hard it was (but how much fun it was) during the first year and to remind us how far we have come. Many people doubted us, but we worked hard, got better and now have a healthy respect for the stem cells and all their uses.</p>

Yes its tough to make neurons, but its doable and we are here to help  as best we can, starting with the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3361000#.XUjw-uhKg2w">protocols</a> we use, going from an iPSC to <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">cortical neurons, or the </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Dopaminergic neurons you see below (Adapted from our open access <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00047/full">Frontiers review</a>).</span></p>

<p>For today, I will be starting in the future, by looking at how we work with dopaminergic neuronal progenitors , directing them into dopaminergic neurons. This protocol also applies for making cortical neurons, as it follows the same workflow, albeit with different factors used in making the progenitors. How we make the progenitors is what I will explain in my next installment.</p>
<p>When we make dopaminergic neurons, we always make a large batch of progenitors, so we can use the same batch in a given study as much as possible. These are cells primed to become neurons, but they still divide and proliferate until we give them the media and factors to drive them into neurons. A lot of the details are in the SOP, so I won’t go too much into it. But once you have progenitors, you can easily generate the dopaminergic or cortical neurons needed for your experiments, depending on the type of progenitor you made at the start.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, be careful with your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cell density</strong></span>, this is crucial in getting good neuronal cultures, too many cells or too few cells and you won’t get good neurons. So figuring this out for each cell-line is crucial. Neurons grow differently from line to line, which also needs to be accounted for.</p>
<p>Also look out for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>proliferating cells</strong></span>. Often, when you start neuronal differentiation, you have cells that won’t differentiate, and they remain proliferative. If left unchecked, they can grow out of hand and contaminate your cultures. This is why we use mitomycin C to reduce these cells, leading to more pure cultures, although you will always have other cell types, including astrocytes. Having too pure neurons is also an issue, as having astrocytes and other glial cells can be good for maturing and maintaining your neuronal cultures, so its something to consider.</p>
<p>These neurons can be grown for many weeks in 2D and are a great source of human neurons for modelling diseases of the brain in a dish. But our story doesn&#8217;t end here, as 3D neuronal organoids take things one step further. This is something I will explain before the month is over. So, enjoy our two new SOPs, one is our <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3361000#.XUjw-uhKg2w">regular pdf</a> for generating neurons from progenitors, and the other is our <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3361006#.XUjyqehKg2w">interactive one</a> to help with training. I hope you enjoy the trip down memory lane with me as you learn a little about our humble beginnings, remember everyone has to start somewhere. On Friday, I will describe how we generate these neuronal progenitors from iPSCs. Until next time, think of me the next time you enjoy a cool umbrella containing drink.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My main project resolves around the E3 ligase UBE3A (I will be writing a project overview for this later), but I am also continuing some work in the same vein as <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/past-scientist/jolene-ho/">Jolene Ho&#8217;s work</a> looking at role of HTT in neurological disorders.</p>
<p>HTT encodes a protein called huntingtin whose function is not known but appears to be crucial to neuron function.  Mutant HTT is frequently associated with Huntington&#8217;s Disease (HD), where the 5&#8242; end of the <em>HTT</em> gene is observed to have an expanded CAG repeat region &#8211; the trinucleotide is repeated more times in individuals with HD than in normal individuals. In HD, mutant HTT is observed to affect neuronal function and structure leading to progressive neurodegeneration, however the exact disease mechanism is not well understood.</p>
<p>To study the function of HTT and the effects of mutant HTT protein <em>in vivo</em>, I will try to introduce trackable copies of <em>HTT </em>into mammalian cells, specifically neuronal cells. By overexpressing the HTT protein in varying amounts and with varying number of CAG repeats, we can try to elucidate the normal function of HTT in a non-disease context and examine how mutant HTT protein affects cell function and leads to neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>As seen in <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/past-scientist/jolene-ho/">Jolene&#8217;s previous posts</a>, it is can be difficult to express such a large protein in cells. Jolene attempted to express HTT in <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/overexpression-of-expanded-htt-in-brain-cancer-cell-lines/">two brain cancer cell lines</a>, but found limited success. I am using the same <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/overexpressing-htt-in-mammalian-cells/">BacMAM virus system</a> previously established at the SGC and attempting to apply it in the widely used neuroblast cell line SH-SY5Y. The protocols for the experiments described below and additional data can be found on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3361015#.XUj8POhKiMo">Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>With limited examples of the use of BacMAM in SH-SY5Y in the literature, I decided to test a range of virus amounts and included a BacMAM GFP control which I could visualize under the microscope to see how effective it was in SH-SY5Y. In line with <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/overexpressing-htt-in-mammalian-cells/">Jolene&#8217;s optimization experiments</a> and a paper I found using BacMAM to overexpress wildtype and mutant LRRK2 implicated in Parkinson&#8217;s Disease  (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3429506/">22952710</a>), I used up to 25% v/v of p3 (passage 3) BacMAM virus to transduce SH-SY5Y and included HEK293 for comparison.</p>
<p>The LRRK2 article (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3429506/">22952710</a>) assayed cells for protein expression 48 hours post-transduction, so I thought I would get decent HTT expression within the same time-frame. I tracked GFP expression for 48 hours to get an overall idea of how effective the virus is in SH-SHY5. To detect HTT expression, I followed-up with FLAG-tag immunofluorescence (IF) in the SH-SY5Y (note: HEK293 don&#8217;t adhere very well and wash off easily so IF can&#8217;t be done with them). I find that GFP is very well expressed in both the HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines after 48hrs, however, I did not detect any FLAG-tagged HTT in my IF (see RFP signal in figure below). This suggest that expression levels of the FLAG-tagged HTT from my BacMAM virus is likely too low to be detected using IF.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-300x137.png" alt="" width="654" height="299" class="aligncenter wp-image-3285" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-300x137.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-768x350.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BacMAM_HTT_48hrs-01-1024x467.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /></p>
<p>I decided to repeat the transduction in a larger 24-well format and harvest cells for a western to see if I could detect any HTT expression. I also changed the harvest point to 3 days post-transduction as Jolene successfully in detected overexpressed HTT in HEK293 with a longer 3-day post-transduction expression period. I observed some SH-SHY5 cells began dying 2 days post-transduction, with more cells dying and lifting off in higher v/v of BacMAM virus. After 3 days, I was only able to harvest the cells with 5% BacMAM virus for my western as most of the cells at higher v/v BacMAM virus died.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-300x148.png" alt="" width="675" height="333" class="aligncenter wp-image-3284" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-300x148.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-768x379.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01-1024x506.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTT_combined-01.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></p>
<p>In my western, I detected FLAG-tagged HTT in the positive controls (D1 &#8211; 23 CAG repeats, D2 &#8211; 54 CAG repeats), but I did not detect any in both my SH-SY5Y grown for 3 days and 6 days post-transduction. It is possible that 5% v/v BacMAM virus is too low, but before I can move forward with higher v/v, I need to optimize conditions for the transduction in SH-SY5Y so that fewer cells die. The SH-SY5Y cells may be dying from either too much virus, the side effects of overexpressing HTT, or incompatibility with the Sf9 media the BacMAM virus is in. Moving forward, I will have to test these possibilities and optimize transduction conditions to maximize overexpression HTT while reducing cell death.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Anti-FLAG purification of the HTT C-HEAT domain. Eluted protein is seen in the red box!</p>
<p>This purification was first done by <a href="http://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a> (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XUQ4snspA2x">Zenodo</a>). Following her purification protocol, I obtained good yields of protein (0.45 mg of protein per L of Sp9 cells) which I immediately used to set crystal trays and to initiate biophysical characterization.</p>
<p>In future purifications, my aim is to improve purity as I noticed the sample was not very clean (low molecular weight proteins and nucleic acid). Further, I want to do a more stringent analysis to determine the most ideal buffer conditions for the sample using DSLS and DSF. I also would like to use SDS-PAGE and native PAGE to determine the progression of the limited proteolysis over time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all, it’s been a while since my last post; I’ve been busy in the lab purifying new protein constructs, developing a new assay and expanding the chemical series of my weak binding hits for USP5 ZnF-UBD, so there will be a couple of posts coming your way in the following weeks.</p>
<p>This week, my post focuses on my efforts to expand the chemical series against USP5 ZnF-UBD to continue to understand the structure activity relationship (SAR) and improve potency. I used GLIDE to dock commercial analogues of hit compounds DAT00000194a and DAT00000201a (Table 1) as well as fragments from my selection of ligands from my work at <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/virtual-screening-with-molecular-forecaster/">Molecular Forecaster (MFI).</a> The source library for the search for analogues of DAT00000194 and DAT00000201 was Enamine’s REAL database of 700 million chemically accessible compounds.

<p>20 commercial compounds were selected and ordered based on docking pose, protein-ligand interactions, docking score, chemical groups, and cost. For example, an analogue of DAT00000201a was chosen based on the hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions of the chemical group extending from the phenyl ring. The docked pose suggests a potential hydrogen bond interaction with residue D264 and hydrophobic interactions with residue M266 (Figure 1).</p>
<p>You can see some of the selected compounds at the end of this post, and download the sdf file!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1</strong>. a) Analogue of DAT00000201a b) Surface representation of USP5 ZnF-UBD with DAT00000201a (cyan) and docked pose of analogue compound (tan) [PDB: 6DXH]; c) Ribbon representation of USP5 ZnF-UBD and docked pose of analogue compound [PDB: 6DXH]</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how well the analogues bind to USP5 ZnF-UBD, and how the crystallized pose of the ligands will compare to the docked pose. When the compounds arrive in a couple of weeks, I’ll be testing these compounds using a surface plasmon resonance assay. Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>The four, structurally similar Mur ligases are essential for the survival of gram-negative bacteria and are therefore potential targets for new antibiotics.  Crystallographic fragment screening may provide new avenues for inhibitor development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to almost all clinically available antibiotics is one of the biggest healthcare challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The biosynthesis pathway of the peptidoglycan (PG) layer of the bacterial cell wall has proven to be a suitable target for clinically relevant antibiotics. PG biosynthesis starts in the cytoplasm of gram-negative bacteria with MurA and MurB generating the initial precursor UDP-N-acetyl muramic acid. The four structurally similar, ATP-dependent Mur ligases (Mur C,D,E,F) catalyze the stepwise addition of a pentapeptide to the precursor before it gets translocated across the plasma membrane (Kouidmi <em>et al.</em>, 2014). All four enzymes are essential for bacterial survival and there was initially great hope that they might serve as targets for new antibiotics. Unfortunately, Mur ligases met the same fate as most other targets for new antibiotics of the high-throughput (HT) screening era: none of the identified compounds ever made it into a clinical program (Silver, 2013). So, the title above really deserves a huge question mark at this point!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe that there is some scope for at least compound development due to the availability of the <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html">XChem fragment screening</a> platform. Fragment based drug discovery is a viable alternative to HT screening (Erlanson <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The possible number of drug-like compounds with up to 30 heavy atoms is astronomical, whereas fragments contain typically less than 20 non-hydrogen atoms, which reduces the number of possible compounds enormously. Hence, a fragment library with just a thousand compounds samples chemical space a lot more efficiently than a HT library with millions of compounds and because of their smaller size, fragments exhibit reduced molecular complexity: larger compounds can form more interactions, but that means that even just a single, ‘wrongly’ placed atom can ruin an otherwise perfectly fitting compound. Fragments form fewer interactions and therefore have almost always far higher hit rates than HT screens, because they sample the binding properties of a protein more comprehensively. And fragment screens often produce not just a single lead, but provide a diverse set of starting points. The drawback is that fewer interactions means reduced affinity, which in return means binding of a fragment is often more challenging to detect. Unfortunately, high compound concentrations interfere with most assays. Fragment screening by X-ray crystallography does not have this problem; here only the solubility of the compound is limiting. Plus, screening by X-ray crystallography allows immediate visualization of the protein-fragment interaction, making false-positive hits virtually impossible. The reason why it was so far rarely used as a primary screening method is because of its limited throughput.</p>
<p>Mur ligases consist of two domains which undergo significant  domain movements upon ATP binding (figure 1), and which has a huge effect on their binding properties (figure 2b,c). Poor cell penetrance of inhibitors may only partly explain why most compounds fail when tested in vivo. Another reason could be that they actually compete with high intracellular concentrations of substrates or cofactors. Most structure-based drug design projects of Mur ligases focused on compounds targeting the ATP binding site. Therefore, targeting secondary or allosteric binding sites could circumvent this problem. Crystallographic fragment screening makes it easy to detect secondary binding sites (figure 2a) (Ludlow et al., 2015). Mur ligases are highly flexible, with the shape of their surface changing considerably during the catalytic cycle (figure 1). Any drugs binding outside the substrate or ATP binding pocket will not compete with endogenous ligands, but will nevertheless interfere with ligase activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Workplan</h1>
<p>Clone, express and purify MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF from Escherichia coli. Then perform crystallographic fragment screening at the XChem facility at the Diamond Light Source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Current status</h1>
<p>We have already some results, but we are unfortunately a bit behind in documenting the progress of the project on <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/">Open Lab Notebooks</a>. Additionally,  we have in the meantime teamed up with Chris Swain (Cambridge MedChem Consulting), Matthew Todd (UCL) and Chris Dowson (Warwick University) in order to help the project progress more quickly. Chris and Matthew have created a platform on Github to invite anyone with an interest in open source drug discovery to throw in ideas: <a href="https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics">https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics</a>. Also, structures can already be viewed and downloaded via <a href="https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/landing">FRAGALYSIS</a>. Nevertheless, we will provide more detailed protocols about how the proteins were prepared etc. shortly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I joined the group of Dr. Cheryl Arrowsmith 2 months ago. Currently, I am working on the Huntington’s disease project along with <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a> and <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/jacob-mcauley/">Jacob McAuley</a>. During these past two months, I have been learning how to purify huntingtin (HTT) protein and overall getting up to date with the project.</p>
<p>A brief introduction to the project: HTT is a 348 KDa protein that is vital for development <sup>1</sup>. HTT has a polyglutamine repeat at its N-terminus which is normally no longer than 35 repeats (Figure 1). When this number of repeats exceeds 38 repeats, it causes Huntington’s disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurological disorder that occurs in adulthood and sometimes in children <sup>2</sup>. Thus, like many other neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, HD is also caused by a protein with an abnormal function in the cell. There are very limited treatments available for HD patients in part because there is little information about the function and structure of HTT and mutant HTT.</p>

<p>In the cell, HTT is thought to be involved in several important protein-protein interactions that are critical for cellular vesicular transport, endocytosis, autophagy and the regulation of transcription <sup>3,7</sup>. However, the complete picture of the function of HTT in the cell is yet not fully determined.</p>
<p>HTT is made up of three different domains. Two HEAT <sup>8,9</sup> (<u>H</u>untingtin, <u>E</u>longation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2<u>A</u>, <u>T</u>arget of rapamycin 1) domains at the N-terminus and C-terminus which are connected by a bridge. However, HTT has several disordered regions within these domains, which makes structural studies of HTT challenging. Recently, the cryo-EM structure of the protein was obtained making a huge step forward to understand more about HTT <sup>10</sup>. However, almost a quarter of the structure of HTT is still unknown in part due to the dynamic nature of this protein.</p>
<p>The main focus of my project is to obtain the 3D structure of the individual domains of the HTT protein, namely the N-terminal HEAT domain, the bridge and C-terminal HEAT domain. With this approach, we hope to better define structural elements in the protein. Further, studies with the individual domains will also be useful to understand what the role of each of the domains is within HTT. By learning about the structure and function of the individual domains, we can learn about HTT’s function inside the cell. I will be posting updates on the research progress so stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an Irishman, I am well versed in roundabouts, we love them. Entering the roundabout, going around it and then hoping to get off it when its your exit. If you don’t exit, you just keep going round and around and around, well you get the drift. It reminds me of that great scene in National Lampoon&#8217;s European vacation where the Griswalds enter an English roundabout and just keep going around in circles for hours. If you don’t know what I am talking about, then check it out, I can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgX6qlJEMc">wait</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, welcome back, you enjoy the video, of course you did, how could you not. Now, I know you must be wondering, Tom what are you on about, just get to the point. Did you hit your head on a Montreal construction cone, not once have you mentioned dinosaurs. Well I am taking a break from dinosaurs today. And the reason for my earlier meander about roundabouts, is because I am going to talk a little about the unending circle of iPSC quality control (QC), which in my mind is just like any major roundabout in Dublin or London. Always moving in a circular fashion as we check and recheck our cells to ensure we are working with top-notch iPSCs. And the reason for this, your stem cell culture is the core of all your experiments, have a bad cell or a bad batch, and you will be having one bad week, month or even year. Trust me, I know all too well this feeling which is why our group, and in particular Carol (I talked about her in my last <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/phew-its-hot-today-lets-chill-out-and-freeze-down-some-ipscs/">blog</a>) and her fellow iPSC specialist Narges Abdian have gone to great lengths to implement our roundabout of iPSC quality control, which I encourage you all to adopt or to share with me ideas on what you do in your group or ideas we could take on board.</p>
<p>I will only loosely explain it here, but I do encourage you to check out our <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3348428#.XTfc_-hKg2w">poster</a> on this. Carol presented this at the recent International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) meeting in LA at the end of June. For those who missed her poster, we are making it available for all to see, to read and to start a dialog over the importance of quality control.</p>
<p>For us, we take several steps to ensure that when we make a new line or receive a line from elsewhere that it checks all the boxes of a “<em>bona fide”</em> good line to be used in experiments. These steps include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Check your iPSC is pluripotent:</u></strong> We image cells for common pluripotency markers and also check for these markers by qPCR. You can also look at the morphology of your cells, and if they don&#8217;t look like an iPSC, then you have big problems. But if you pass this first step, now it is on to <strong>Step 2</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>Does your cell grow well</u></strong>: For this we do a combination of live cell imaging in two different stem cell medias (mTESR and Essential 8) and check for cell growth and cell viability through a combination of live cell imaging and crystal violet staining. Some lines grow well on both medias, but there are times when a line might prefer one line versus another, so that’s important to keep in mind.</li>
<li><strong><u>Is the genome of the cell stable</u></strong>: For this you can look at total chromosome number, along with genetic duplications that often arise. These can often confer selective growth advantages for your cell-line so its important to check this when working with any cell-line. You can also do other methods like whole-genome sequencing to check the entire genetic sequence of your cell-line, and this is currently in progress for many of our control iPSCs and the lines they were derived from, so this data we will soon have for a number of our lines being made available.</li>
<li><strong><u>Can my stem cell form other cells:</u></strong> Obviously when you are working with a stem cell, you might want a specific cell type. So, if your cell is good, you can always go ahead and try your SOP for generating the cell-line you want. But another way to test the differentiation potential is through a <a href="https://www.stemcell.com/stemdiff-trilineage-differentiation-kit.html">trilineage test</a> in which you promote the formation of endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it, our roundabout of iPSC QC; our little circle of life. We will be adding more to this process over the next month, as we are in the preparation phase of a manuscript on iPSC QC. More data is being added so we will return to this roundabout in due time.</p>
<p>You will also notice from the poster we have made and profiled 10 healthy control lines relative to cells from other sources. Yes, you can now access these iPSCs through the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/c-bigneuro/">MNI C-BIG</a> and <a href="cbig.mni@mcgill.ca">requests</a> for the lines can be made. Other lines are entering their freezers in coming weeks and months from our Parkinson&#8217;s disease and ALS cohorts, and I will keep you all updated as they become available for access under the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/open-science-0">open science</a> principles of the MNI.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Next week, I start to outline how we make and work with neurons from patient-derived iPSCs. Got to run, </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">this is my exit, or I will be on this roundabout forever. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the immortal words of Ron Burgundy “<em><strong>Its so hot… milk was a bad choice</strong></em>”. Man, it is a scorcher today, with a humidex of really humid, now I know how cells feel like living in an incubator. But when its hot, what better way to cool down then with an ice cold beverage (I mean freshly frozen tube of stem cells). As promised, the continuation of <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Tuesday&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/thawing-your-tube-of-ipscs/">blog</a> in which we learn to maintain iPSCs, to split iPSCs, and yes, as it says it in the title, to freeze down iPSCs. Before I get started, I have been inundated with requests from people asking how the dinosaurs are doing, I don’t know if they are mocking me, or if they are serious. But thank you for asking, they are doing well and no they don&#8217;t have their own instagram account, here is my first and last picture of my collection as they like their privacy. As you </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">can </span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">see, blue has a special place in my heart looking after my stress ball brain, he sits in on all my meetings giving constructive advice as we all work to take a bite out of the modern scientific problems of our day (haha, sorry that was an awful pun, please forgive me).</span></p>

<p>Ok, enough of the fun and games, lets get down to serious business. Your cells are attached and growing, so every day you must now keep an eye on them to make sure they are happy. Also, every day you need to change the media. How all this works is in the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3337402#.XS-1vehKg2x">SOP</a> we published on Tuesday. There are some new approaches in which you can skips days but the preference for our group is daily media changes. As your cells grow, they will form tightly packed colonies that grow and expand in size over about 6-7 days until they reach confluency. But the growth rate can vary from line to line, and depends on the media you use, so be mindful of this when doing your cultures. Also look out for differentiation, or when the cells become bad. This is like when they lose their superpowers and are no longer a superhero but just a regular person, or in stem cell terms, they lose their pluripotency. Images of what this looks like are below, monitor daily for the bad cells, when you see them try to remove them, it helps in keeping the cells all nice and pluripotent.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCRM1_diff_mTeSR1_10x-300x143.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="291" class="aligncenter wp-image-3190" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCRM1_diff_mTeSR1_10x-300x143.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCRM1_diff_mTeSR1_10x-768x366.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCRM1_diff_mTeSR1_10x-1024x488.jpg 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCRM1_diff_mTeSR1_10x.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></p>
<p>Once the cells have reached critical mass and in our <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3337402#.XS-1vehKg2x">SOP</a>, we have recommendations on when this is, then you are ready to passage. This means removing the cells from the dish they are on, to put a small amount of these cells onto a new dish to grow again. To do so, we use gentle cell dissociation media to lift the cells from the plates. These cells are pelleted, resuspended in media, and then carefully, pipetted to break the aggregates down to add onto a new plate. This plate is coated like we describe in Tuesday’s <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/thawing-your-tube-of-ipscs/">blog</a>. If you don’t have a coated dish, then gulp. You better pray someone else does, or your best bet is to simply freeze the cells down.</p>
<p>Now for freezing cells, its pretty much the same as passaging, with one small exception, this is the end of the cells current journey as they are heading to the liquid nitrogen tank in the big storage room down the hall. Once you have your cell pellet, resuspend in freeze down media, and calculate the cell viability and total cell number. Based on your numbers, pipette your cell suspension into multiple cryogenic vials, and then voila, ready for the freezer. This is a stepwise freezing process, so start at -20 degrees, then -80 after a few hours, and then the next day to their final destination, the liquid nitrogen tank where it stays until you need it again, or until someone else needs it.</p>
<p>So there we have it, the highest-level overview of doing iPSC culture, but all the details are <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3337402#.XS-1vehKg2x">here</a>.  Everything we do is outlined in the <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/thawing-your-tube-of-ipscs/">blog</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3337402#.XS_oFuhKg2x">here</a>, I can’t take the credit, actually I get zero credit, this is all my team, I just write about it. The real credit in particular goes to the person who trained me on iPSCs, and who is my real boss, <a href="xiuqing.chen@mcgill.ca">Dr. Carol Chen</a> pictured below. Fun fact about Carol, she started a year before me in the lab, and I have driven her crazy every day for 12 years, but she is a fountain of knowledge and puts my lab skills to shame, while keeping a steady flow of chocolate coming my way. She trains everyone in our group for iPSCs, and when people need to be trained from other groups, she is the go to person for helping people to learn and is one of many great team members I get to come and work with every day. You will get to meet many of them in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carol-action-shot_compressed-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-3192 aligncenter" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carol-action-shot_compressed-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carol-action-shot_compressed-768x513.jpg 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carol-action-shot_compressed-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>And its not just our regular <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3337402#.XS_o3ehKg2x">SOP</a> that we use for training. We are trying something a little different and more immersive, so this is brand new and we hope you like it. If you have comments or feedback we would love to hear from you and this goes for all SOPs, if you think, oh gosh Tom, your such an idiot, then please tell me, we want to do the best work we can and if people have advice then please lets talk, if you have editing errors you spot, then please go ahead and provide me a <a href="thomas.durcan@mcgill.ca">list</a>. As you can tell, I wasn&#8217;t very good with English grammar at school.</p>
<p>Now for our SOP pdf, we took it, tore it apart, put it back together again and created a hands-on training module, that is now on tablets in our culture room. This means when people learn iPSCs, no need for paper. A real-time, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3340189#.XS_u3uhKg2w">clickable SOP</a> on a tablet for people to work off, paired with the interactive <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3270914#.XS-5cOhKg2x">reagent list</a>. All credit for this goes to <a href="xiuqing.chen@mcgill.ca">Carol Chen</a>, <a href="cecilia.rocha@mcgill.ca">Cecilia Rocha</a> and <a href="trisha.rao@mcgill.ca">Trisha Rao</a> who took this on board and led this, and I hope you agree with me, its great and we are hoping to test it over coming months within our group and adapt it for a number of our other protocols. And hopefully it will be a great <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3340189#.XS_u3uhKg2w">learning tool</a> for anyone new who wants to work with stem cells no matter where you are.</p>
<p>Ok, so this is our first part done, three blogs down, seven to go. You sick of me yet, course you are. My dedicated fans still stick with me (hi mom)  Next week, we will discuss our pipeline for monitoring iPSC quality. For this, I will be making available Carol’s poster from the ISSCR meeting in LA a few weeks ago, which I know you will all love. So enjoy the weekend and after all this talk of cold drinks, I better go get myself a cold beverage and cool off. Over the next week will try something new which is hats. As I approach 40, I am trying new things, so hats seemed like a good thing to try, I might have a picture next week of me in a hat depending on how I think i look, and we can decide if its good or bad for Tom to wear a hat with my sizeable noggin. Until next week, you stay classy San Diego.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last post, I told you about my initial results soaking follow-up compounds into preformed HAO1 crystals. In order to generate more crystals (and so more structures), I purified some new protein (I’ll call it ‘batch #2’ for simplicity). However, this second batch, when crystallised, did not take up any of the soaked in compounds and so I set out to find out why. The first indication was in the structure itself which showed that there was much less density for FMN in the second batch (Figure 1D) than in the first (Figure 1C) with the map showing negative (red) density when I placed FMN into its accustomed place.</p>
<p>I confirmed that the second batch was less loaded with FMN by measuring the FMN concentration, relative to protein, in solution by absorbance. As you can see in  Figure 1A, the protein peak (at 280 nm) is very similar for both batches but the dual peaks (376 nm and 450 nm) expected for FMN are much smaller in batch #2 relative to batch #1, indicating much less FMN per unit protein. Further investigation also revealed that: a) batch #2 was much less active than batch #1 (Figure 1B, blue/green); b) adding extra FMN did not improve protein activity (Figure 1B, red/purple); and c) soaking of batch #2 crystals with FMN did not improve FMN occupancy in the structures, further supporting that co-factor binding could not be restored in purified protein.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig1-1024x510.png" alt="" width="780" height="388" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3169" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig1-1024x510.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig1-300x150.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig1-768x383.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Figure 1: </i></b><b><i>Comparison of FMN content of HAO1 batches. </i></b><i>A. Measurement of FMN by absorbance. Protein peak at 280 nm, FMN peaks at 376 nm and 450 nm. B. Measurement of HAO1 assay with and without equimolar (1:1) added FMN. C. Full occupancy of FMN in batch #1 protein crystal. D. Poor occupancy of FMN in batch #2 protein crystal</i></p>
<p>To explain how a lack of FMN could explain a lack of binding of soaked compounds, I theorised that there must be some changes in flexibility of the gating loop so that in the absence of FMN the loop does not move to allow ligand binding. This theory was initially based on the fact that, unlike previous apo (ligand free) structures of HAO1, the entire gating loop of the batch #2 crystal structures had sufficient density to be modelled (Figure 2B). In previous structures, a fully ordered gating loop was only observed when the loop was in effect ‘locked-down’ by the binding of substrate to batch #1 protein (e.g. PDB code 6GMB; Figure 2C), whereas batch #1 protein crystals without soaked substrate had flexible loops with some residues not able to be built (Figure 2A).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig2-1024x484.png" alt="" width="780" height="369" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3170" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig2-1024x484.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig2-300x142.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post10-fig2-768x363.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Figure </i></b><b><i>2: Comparison of loop flexibility of HAO1 structures. </i></b><i>A. Batch #</i><i>1, </i><i>used for fragment screening. In the absence of substrate, the loop shows high mobility. B. Batch #</i><i>2, unsuccessful in soaking compounds. </i><i>Lower mobility loop. C. Batch #1 crystallised with substrate to ‘lock down’ loop. Low mobility loop.</i></p>
<p>This theory is supported by comparing the <em>B-factors</em> of the loop regions in the different structures. Each atom or group of atoms within a crystal structure is assigned a B-factor which represents the uncertainty in their position dependent on three factors: <em>static</em> disorder, caused by different protein molecules within the same crystal having different conformations; <em>dynamic</em> disorder, representing the movement of the atoms themselves; and <em>coordinate error</em>, attributable to atom(s) that are placed wrongly in the model. A combination of the former two (alongside a minimisation of the latter) gives a good indication of the relative mobility of different protein regions. In this case, we can see from figure 2 that the protein crystals I have used to successfully soak my compounds had highly mobile/disordered loops (Figure 2A, batch #1 without substrate) whereas later structures, from batch #2 (Figure 2B), have much lower b-factors in the loop region. As expected, the least mobile gating loop (lowest b-factors) is found in the structure of HAO1 with substrate (batch #1 with substrate, Figure 2C).</p>
