				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In my previous <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/expression-test-and-purification-of-setdb1-catalytic-domain-constructs-for-structural-studies-by-x-ray-crystallography/">post</a>, I shared the expression and purification results of several constructs based on bacterial expression systems. Such experiments often fail as there are inherent complications with protein expression associated with bacterial expression systems. This was likely the case for most of our last batch samples. To tackle this problem, we decided to switch a more complex protein production machinery, insect cells.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although there are downsides of insect cells, higher costs and longer duration of culture growth (2-3 weeks), they have many advantages over bacterial cells. They can perform post-translational modifications (some sort of chemical marks on the proteins) and, folding of mammalian originated proteins. These increase the likelihood of expression and improve the solubility of end-products, proteins. Therefore, important to note that proteins produced by insect cells are also often more functional than those produced in bacterial systems.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In our initial trials, we had made four different constructs exploiting a commonly used insect cell platform called Sf9. (“Sf” stands for the initials of “</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Spodoptera frugiperda</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.”) Unfortunately, these initial trials also did not provide a positive result for the expression of SETDB1 catalytic domain. The details of samples and results are available in this <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3612642#.XiXFJMhKjcs">Zenodo post</a>. We will continue to test Sf9 cells to identify well expressing and soluble SETDB1 constructs and keep sharing our progress here.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recombinant protein expression is a prominent molecular technique for structural biology studies. For expressing recombinant proteins, a host organism is utilized as protein production factories. To obtain the desired recombinant proteins, we first design a recombinant DNA, which involves the information of protein to be produced. Then, we clone the desired DNA fragments into a system that assists the expression process. We call them “construct.”</p>
<p>A wide range of host organisms can be used for protein expression, ranging from bacteria and yeasts to animal (insect/mammalian) and even plant cells. However, bacterial expression systems have many advantages over other host systems as they allow high-level expression at low cost. Therefore, we prefer testing bacterial cells (<em>Escherichia coli</em>) first before moving to more complex systems.</p>
<p>Here, in this post, we share all the constructs tested so far by me, Cheng Dong, and Lei Ming to produce a high amount of soluble SETDB1 protein. We have tested more than 80 constructs that correspond to different regions of the catalytic domain of SETDB1 protein. Out of these 80 trials, only 3 constructs have shown a positive result for expression. We listed the details of the constructs tested in this <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3464534#.XZy9o0ZKjcs">Zendo post</a>.</p>
<p>In our next experiments, we plan to focus on improving the purity of proteins obtained by these 3 constructs. In addition to the optimization of purification process, we will also characterize the stability of resulting proteins before toward the efforts aimed at structural elucidation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The molecular blueprint of the living organisms, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), is often wrapped with a family of proteins, called histones, in mammalian cells. The functions of histones are vast, including the protection of DNA, and most importantly, the regulation of gene expression. However, the details of gene regulation function of histones are not clearly understood, at least in terms of the helper molecules involved in this process.<br />
We focus on a specific protein called SETDB1, which chemically modifies a certain part of the histones, causing the formation of a gene silencing signal (called H3K9me3). This gene silencing signal, which is a form of histone code, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including many cancer types. We are motivated to find out a way to inhibit the abnormal functioning of SETDB1 that contributes to the progression of certain diseases. Our approach to do so is to solve the three-dimensional structure of SETDB1, which will help pharmaceutical researchers to design highly potent drug molecules.<br />
As a general strategy, we first had a closer look at the domain organization of SETDB1, which also shows the functional layout of the protein (as shown in the figure below). SETDB1 is a large protein with a molecular weight of 143.1 kDa (approximately 400 times of table sugar, sucrose). From a structural as well as functional perspective, one side of the protein is studied very well. (See the blue boxes, called Tudor domains) However, the other sides are relatively unknown.</p>

How SETDB1 looks like when we map out its functional units.</p></div>
<p>The aim of this project is to gather the structural information of relatively less resolved regions of the SETDB1 protein, which perform the catalytic activity. To achieve our goal, we will design new clones, expressing different regions of the protein and optimize their protein purifications. To keep you posted, we will share essential data and experimental design strategies that we develop here in this blog in the future. As always, we love to hear your thoughts.</p>
