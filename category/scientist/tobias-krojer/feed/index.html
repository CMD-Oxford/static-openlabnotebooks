				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>The four, structurally similar Mur ligases are essential for the survival of gram-negative bacteria and are therefore potential targets for new antibiotics.  Crystallographic fragment screening may provide new avenues for inhibitor development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to almost all clinically available antibiotics is one of the biggest healthcare challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The biosynthesis pathway of the peptidoglycan (PG) layer of the bacterial cell wall has proven to be a suitable target for clinically relevant antibiotics. PG biosynthesis starts in the cytoplasm of gram-negative bacteria with MurA and MurB generating the initial precursor UDP-N-acetyl muramic acid. The four structurally similar, ATP-dependent Mur ligases (Mur C,D,E,F) catalyze the stepwise addition of a pentapeptide to the precursor before it gets translocated across the plasma membrane (Kouidmi <em>et al.</em>, 2014). All four enzymes are essential for bacterial survival and there was initially great hope that they might serve as targets for new antibiotics. Unfortunately, Mur ligases met the same fate as most other targets for new antibiotics of the high-throughput (HT) screening era: none of the identified compounds ever made it into a clinical program (Silver, 2013). So, the title above really deserves a huge question mark at this point!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe that there is some scope for at least compound development due to the availability of the <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html">XChem fragment screening</a> platform. Fragment based drug discovery is a viable alternative to HT screening (Erlanson <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The possible number of drug-like compounds with up to 30 heavy atoms is astronomical, whereas fragments contain typically less than 20 non-hydrogen atoms, which reduces the number of possible compounds enormously. Hence, a fragment library with just a thousand compounds samples chemical space a lot more efficiently than a HT library with millions of compounds and because of their smaller size, fragments exhibit reduced molecular complexity: larger compounds can form more interactions, but that means that even just a single, ‘wrongly’ placed atom can ruin an otherwise perfectly fitting compound. Fragments form fewer interactions and therefore have almost always far higher hit rates than HT screens, because they sample the binding properties of a protein more comprehensively. And fragment screens often produce not just a single lead, but provide a diverse set of starting points. The drawback is that fewer interactions means reduced affinity, which in return means binding of a fragment is often more challenging to detect. Unfortunately, high compound concentrations interfere with most assays. Fragment screening by X-ray crystallography does not have this problem; here only the solubility of the compound is limiting. Plus, screening by X-ray crystallography allows immediate visualization of the protein-fragment interaction, making false-positive hits virtually impossible. The reason why it was so far rarely used as a primary screening method is because of its limited throughput.</p>
<p>Mur ligases consist of two domains which undergo significant  domain movements upon ATP binding (figure 1), and which has a huge effect on their binding properties (figure 2b,c). Poor cell penetrance of inhibitors may only partly explain why most compounds fail when tested in vivo. Another reason could be that they actually compete with high intracellular concentrations of substrates or cofactors. Most structure-based drug design projects of Mur ligases focused on compounds targeting the ATP binding site. Therefore, targeting secondary or allosteric binding sites could circumvent this problem. Crystallographic fragment screening makes it easy to detect secondary binding sites (figure 2a) (Ludlow et al., 2015). Mur ligases are highly flexible, with the shape of their surface changing considerably during the catalytic cycle (figure 1). Any drugs binding outside the substrate or ATP binding pocket will not compete with endogenous ligands, but will nevertheless interfere with ligase activity.</p>

<h1>Workplan</h1>
<p>Clone, express and purify MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF from Escherichia coli. Then perform crystallographic fragment screening at the XChem facility at the Diamond Light Source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Current status</h1>
<p>We have already some results, but we are unfortunately a bit behind in documenting the progress of the project on <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/">Open Lab Notebooks</a>. Additionally,  we have in the meantime teamed up with Chris Swain (Cambridge MedChem Consulting), Matthew Todd (UCL) and Chris Dowson (Warwick University) in order to help the project progress more quickly. Chris and Matthew have created a platform on Github to invite anyone with an interest in open source drug discovery to throw in ideas: <a href="https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics">https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics</a>. Also, structures can already be viewed and downloaded via <a href="https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/landing">FRAGALYSIS</a>. Nevertheless, we will provide more detailed protocols about how the proteins were prepared etc. shortly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year is coming to an end and I want to start my blog by giving you an overview of a project that kept me busy for the better part of it. Our existing <a href="https://www.wwpdb.org/">Protein Data Bank (PDB)</a> batch deposition mechanism underwent a major overhaul recently and we are finally in a position where we can relatively quickly deposit all the structures from an <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html">XChem fragment screening</a> campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume not everyone will be familiar with what this is about, so here is some background of the problems we are trying to solve: once the XChem facility started churning out more and more protein-fragment complex structures, it became obvious that we needed new tools to support PDB deposition. Doing it one-by-one through the wwPDB website would be too time-consuming. Additionally, the multi-dataset nature of the experiment and the way we analyse the data made it necessary to think about new ways to help the end-user understand the basis of the modelling decisions taken by the depositor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The post is rather long, because it contains quite a few details which might be of interest if you are confronted with having to deposit many similar structures or if you want to publish findings based on a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5413968/">PanDDA</a> analysis. Here&#8217;s a quick summary if you are in a rush:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each deposited structure contains direct evidence for the modelled ligand, i.e. the PanDDA event map</li>
<li>All apo structures that were collected during an XChem experiment are deposited as a single PDB entry so that the data can be used to reproduce the PanDDA analysis</li>
<li>File preparation for batch deposition of ligand bound and apo structures is facilitated by XChemExplorer</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PDB group depositions</h3>
<p>The first problem, i.e. deposition of many structures, was solved quickly, because, fortunately for us, the PDB has already developed a new, but not very well known, portal to support parallel structure depositions, so-called <a href="https://deposit-group-1.rcsb.rutgers.edu/groupdeposit/">group depositions</a>. It’s pretty nifty, you can bundle all your structure and structure factor mmcif files in a single tar archive, then you upload the file and press submit. That&#8217;s it! Well, almost. One still needs to provide the usual experimental data like protein sequence, crystallization condition, authors etc. in the header of each mmcif file, but I’ve implemented a solution in the<a href="https://github.com/xchem/XChemExplorer"> XChemExplorer (XCE)</a> software so that one only needs to do it once and the information then gets propagated to all the structures in a group (Figure 1). Once the user has provided this information in XCE, they need to flag which structures they want to deposit and the program will generate the respective files, ready for upload. That was the – conceptually – easy bit. Next, we had to think about ways to provide evidence for the modelled ligands.</p>
<div id="attachment_2294" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2294" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_1-300x213.png" alt="" width="513" height="364" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_1-300x213.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_1-768x544.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_1.png 907w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. XChemExplorer (XCE) enables preparation of files for mass structure deposition through the PDB group deposition portal. Users only need to provide a minimal amount of information which is then propagated to all files in a group. The remaining information is captured from the XCE database and the project directory. XCE uses PDB_EXTRACT and SF_CONVERT to generate structure and structure factor mmcif files, respectively. XCE can generate and bundle mmcif files of ligand-bound models, as well as of the ground-state model and the corresponding apo structure factor mmcif files.</p></div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Evidence for modelled ligands</h3>
<p>We routinely use the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5413968/">Pan-Dataset Density Analysis (PanDDA)</a> method to identify bound fragments and because the algorithm is so sensitive, we are often able to detect weakly bound compounds which would go unnoticed in 2mFo-DFc maps. However, the concept of PanDDA event maps is still just emerging in the community and so the question is how can we provide the rest of the world with evidence that these ligands really are bound? The last few years have seen a few efforts to improve the quality of protein-ligand structures in the PDB and there have been several publications which highlight dubiously modelled ligands. So, what to do in order to avoid that XChem will soon find itself in the pillory? Together with Stephen Burley’s team at the RCSB, we enabled inclusion of PanDDA event maps in the deposited structure factor mmcif file (Figure 2). This allows everyone – with a bit of crystallographic knowledge – to download the mmcif file and recreate the maps that were used to model the bound ligand and eventual changes in the protein structure. Ideally, the event maps would be displayed on the different PDB websites, but in the meantime, we have created our own <a href="https://www.thesgc.org/fragment-screening">interactive HTML summaries</a> which users can use to share their results with the world. On a personal note, I would like to add that there certainly are ‘fantasy’ models in the PDB, but this is probably unavoidable given the sheer number of structures in the archive and that overall, protein crystallographers are most likely not too dissimilar to the rest of humanity when it comes to the distribution of certain traits. Still, I am sure that most scientists are aware of the limitations of some of their models, but they have no possibility to communicate their concerns. However, this is another topic which I will elaborate on in one of my next blog posts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reproduction of results</h3>
<p>Finally, we also thought about ways to enable anyone to reproduce the event maps. Ultimately, PanDDA event maps cannot be reproduced unless you have all the apo datasets available to calculate the respective statistical maps. Making all the data available, also ensures that PanDDA users can be confident when publishing their results. Technically, this should be trivial in the year 2018 given that the file sizes involved are negligible by today’s standards. The more important (and contentious) question is ‘<em>where should the data live?</em>’. The PDB recommended to deposit them in their archive so that they will be properly curated and remain available in perpetuity. Hence, our initial strategy in 2017 was to bundle all the apo structures in another tar archive and deposit them in a separate group deposition session. But that meant that every apo structure was treated as a unique structure and therefore got its own PDB ID. Needless to say that this created confusion in some parts of the community who were wondering what we are up to. This did clearly not work as expected, not least because even if someone would like the run PanDDA again on the data, they would need a lot of patience if they want to download all the datasets from the PDB. We contemplated to use the <a href="https://zenodo.org/">ZENODO</a> data repository as an alternative (and we still recommend to use this platform to upload the complete PanDDA analysis anyway), but finally we came up with a, which at least I believe, much more elegant solution. Instead of depositing every apo PDB file (which are almost identical after initial refinement), we deposit only the ground-state model (and the corresponding mean map) and then include the structure factors of every dataset that was collected during the XChem experiment in the final structure factor mmcif file (Figure 2). The file will often be several Gb large, but users will now be able to download all the data that they need to reproduce a PanDDA analysis in one go.</p>
<div id="attachment_2295" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2295" src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_2-300x214.png" alt="" width="513" height="365" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_2-300x214.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_2-768x547.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/figure_2.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. File structure and contents of the deposited mmcif files. Each ligand-bound structure (changed_state.pdb) does consist of an mmcif file containing its coordinates and experimental data and a structure factor mmcif file which contains the measured data as well as an additional data block for each PanDDA event map. The ground-state model will be included in a separate mmcif file. The corresponding structure factor mmcif file does contain one block for the mean map and then one block each for every datasets which was part of the XChem experiment. In case someone wants to reproduce the PanDDA analysis, they can download the ground-state deposition, use the model to run initial refinement on every dataset and then subject it to PanDDA analysis. Additionally, there is a possibility to upload the complete PanDDA analysis into the ZENODO data repository and point to it in the PDB deposition.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have recently made our first apo deposition (G_1002058) and are still sorting out a few technicalities. Once this is done, I’m planning to make a few changes to the XCE gui, so that users get a simple step-by-step description what they need to do. Also, I am currently working on a publication which we will hopefully submit early next year and which will provide more details.</p>
