The goal is to evaluate what effect changes in the acid functionality with/without the isopropyl substituent would have on the activity of this series (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). It is hoped that any observed trend in activity, solubility, permeability etc will guide the discovery efforts of this inhibitors series for CaMKK2.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the successful synthesis of the furopyridine scaffold via an alternative synthetic route, conditions have been worked out to optimize yields on the synthesis of the key intermediate: 5-bromobenzofuran-3(2H)-one. Thus far the following set of analogs, <strong>Figure 1</strong>, have been generated by building diversity on the pyridine ring. These analogs together with with proposed others and those earlier on synthesized, would help us to better understand the SAR of this series.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Synthesized CaMKK2 Analogs</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1935 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-300x142.png" alt="" width="688" height="326" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-300x142.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-768x363.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-1024x484.png 1024w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs.png 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above compounds have been submitted for testing and data would be provided as they become available. The highlighted analog, <strong>BE2-084</strong>, was obtained as a result of the unintended hydrolysis of the amide during the final saponification step, <strong>Scheme 1</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 1: Unintended hydrolysis of amide bond</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1936 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-2-300x157.png" alt="" width="399" height="209" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-2-300x157.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CaMKK2-Analogs-2.png 712w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus it was envisioned that starting from 5-bromobenzofuran-3-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate, <strong>3</strong>, analogs <strong>1</strong> (<strong>BE2-089</strong>) or <strong>2</strong> (<strong>BE2-086</strong>), could be achieved via a one-pot synthesis as depicted below, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>. This route does not require the cyclopentyl acid derivative, <strong>4</strong> [2-cyclopentyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoic acid] to be protected (methyl ester), and a test reaction conducted indicates that this route is possible and details would be provided in due course.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Preparation of CaMKK2 analogs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pursuant to our aim of preparing a library of small molecule chemical probes around our most promising core scaffold, furopyridine, we sought to develop different chemistries that would allow us to achieve this objective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original synthetic route, 5-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridine, <strong>1</strong>, was able to undergo the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to install an aryl derivative in compound <strong>2 (Scheme 1)</strong>. This was followed by bromination on the furan ring at the 3-position, which allows the installation of the crucial cyclopentylbenzoic acid derivative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 1: Original Synthetic Route to Furopyridine Analogs</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1621 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1-300x72.png" alt="" width="686" height="165" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1-300x72.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1-768x185.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-1.png 942w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ar = variety of aryl groups<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This method led to the preparation of potent CaMKK2 inhibitors. Examples of analogs prepared and their CaMKK2 activities are provided in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1623 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2-300x79.png" alt="" width="630" height="166" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2-300x79.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2-768x202.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-2.png 954w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Examples of Previously Prepared Furopyridine Analogs at SGC-UNC</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the synthetic route, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>, required repeating step one (1) for each analog prepared, and the bromination step (step 2) limited diversity on the pendant aryl, as many groups get brominated. <strong>Figure 2</strong>, shows the unintended bromination spot (arrow) on the isoxazole ring, for example.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1625 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/furopyridine-3.png" alt="" width="120" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 2: Multiple brominations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, we envisioned that installing the cyclopentylbenzoic acid derivative early in the synthesis (prior to diversification on the pyridine ring), will not only address the bromination issues, but also contribute to preparation of as many analogs as possible within a short space of time. To achieve this, we sought to prepare 3,5-di-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridine, <strong>5</strong>, 5-bromo-3-iodo[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridine, <strong>6</strong>, or 5-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridin-3-yl-trifluoromethanesulfonate, <strong>7</strong>, compounds, <strong>Figure 3</strong>, with a view to incorporating the cyclopentylbenzoic acid derivative chemoselectively at the 3-position on the furan ring.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1632 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-4-1-300x92.png" alt="" width="355" height="109" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-4-1-300x92.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-4-1.png 459w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 3: Proposed Furopyridine Scaffolds for Selective Suzuki Reactions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The di-bromo compound, <strong>5</strong>, has been achieved but selectivity on the furan ring is poor and we are continuing to review different reaction conditions (Suzuki cross-coupling) to achieve the desired selectivity. Iodination at the 3-position in compound <strong>6</strong> has proven much more difficult than anticipated. In an attempt to achieve the triflate derivative in compound <strong>7</strong>, the following synthetic route has been devised, <strong>Scheme 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scheme 2: Synthesis of  5-bromofuro[2,3-<em>b</em>]pyridin-3-yl-trifluoromethanesulfonate</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1634 aligncenter" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-5-300x133.png" alt="" width="512" height="227" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-5-300x133.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Furopyridine-5.png 724w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intermediate ethyl substituted benzoate, <strong>9</strong>,  was easily obtained in good yield via reaction of the acid, <strong>8</strong>, with ethanol in the presence of conc. sulfuric acid (<em>RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 6306, WO 2013/014587</em>). This compound, <strong>9</strong>, was further reacted with ethyl glycolate in the presence of NaH to yield the the bicyclic ester, <strong>10</strong>, (<em>WO 2013/014587</em>) which was refluxed in aqueous NaOH followed by with aqueous HCl to give the key intermediate furopyridinone, <strong>11, </strong>(<em>J.

The compound thus obtained was then converted to the corresponding triflate, <strong>7</strong>, followed by chemoselective palladium-catalyzed coupling with select aryl boronic acids (<em>Synlett 2002, No. 3, 501-503, WO 2010/034671</em>), <strong>Figure 4</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although, steps 2 and 3 (<strong>Scheme 2</strong>) recorded very low yields, <em><strong>gratifyingly</strong></em> we have been able to achieve selectivity for the triflate over the the bromine, with the bromo-derivatives being the only isolable product in most cases, <strong>Figure 4</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">NRF2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins and functions to protect against oxidative stress caused by inflammation. Under normal physiological conditions, NRF2 is degraded by KEAP1 and Cullin 3 (CUL3) through a process called ubiquitination (ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis). Following ubiquitination, it is transported to the proteasome where it is degraded, <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of NRF2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under stress conditions (Hypoxia, ER Stress, Oxidative Stress), the ubiquitination process is disrupted leading to a  build-up of NRF2, which translocates into the nucleus, forms a dimer with MAF proteins and binds to the antioxidant response elements (AREs) and initiates their transcription.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Balanced NRF2 signalling is required to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis, however alterations in NRF2 or KEAP1 or CUL3 is associated with diseases including premature aging, neurodegenerative disorders, chemical induced carcinogenesis, tumor progression, metabolic disorders and resistance to chemotherapy. <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">BRSK2, a member of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) subfamily of serine/threonine kinases is among kinases that repress NRF2 mediated transcription.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this project, we are working with Dr. Ben Major (Dep&#8217;t of Cell Biology and Physiology, UNC) whose lab is  actively engaged in the study of how perturbation of specific signal transduction pathways (specifically KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathways) contributes to the initiation, progression and dissemination of diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Synthesis: </strong>Our initial synthetic efforts are focused on a number of carefully selected analogs that have been shown to be active BRSK2 inhibitors. The general synthetic route is provided below in <strong>Scheme 1</strong>, <strong><em>J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 1996-2015</em></strong>. The commercially available 5-bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde, <strong>1</strong>, was converted to the corresponding 6-bromoquinazolin-2-amine, <strong>2</strong>, following treatment with guanidine carbonate in DMA. The compound thus obtained, was able to undergo Suzuki coupling with 3-pyridinyl- or 4-pyridinylboronic acid to afford the amino derivative <strong>3</strong>. Palladium catalyzed cross-coupling with a variety of arylbromides furnished the final aminoquinazoline analogs (compound <strong>4</strong>, in <strong>Scheme 1</strong>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">I provide herewith my first post –  A short overview of my current projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Research at the SGC-UNC involves the preparation of active chemical probes for understudied protein kinases with the ultimate goal of designing potent small molecule inhibitors as treatment for diseases such as cancer. Kinases play critical roles in cellular signaling which controls important biochemical processes including cellular growth, cell survival, cell motility and immune cell activation. Indeed kinases have emerged as of one the most successful drug target of the current century – leading to greater than 30 small molecule kinase inhibitors approved by the US FDA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have the privilege of working on two (2) interesting projects &#8211; generating a library of chemical probes for the ongoing CAMKK2 project and more recently BRSK2 – both of which are understudied protein kinases. Our goal is to develop potent, selective and cell active compounds as CAMKK2 and BRSK2 chemical probes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CAMKK2</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our aim is to prepare large numbers of small molecule chemical probes via robust synthetic chemistry that will enable fast and efficient diversification (SAR) around our core scaffolds &#8211; Furopyridines, pyrrolopyridines, quinolines and other hinge binders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BRSK2</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A series of small molecule aminoquinolines have recently been published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry that inhibit mutant B-Raf kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. These aminoquinolines are also found to be active in inhibiting BRSK2 kinase activity. To this end, we are preparing a series of aminoquinolines to confirm the reported BRSK2 inhibitory activity and ultimately design small molecules that would be selective for BRSK2. Early indications on the initial analog of this series suggests the aminoquinolines offers a great starting to this drug discovery effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I will be providing details of my synthetic strategies and data as I receive them in the course of time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many thanks to entire the SGC-UNC team, particularly to David, Alison, Tim and Kim.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cheers!</p>
