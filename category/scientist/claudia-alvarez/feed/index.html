				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the second purification round of <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3562523#.XeflbdVOnb0">N-HEAT_81-1643</a>, I added an additional purification step with heparin resin. My aim with doing this additional step was to improve the purity of the HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 sample from nucleic acid material/other proteins. Similar experiments proved successful for full HTT+HAP40 sample (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3234174#.Xefm19VOnb0">by Dr. Rachel Harding</a>). Our results showed that the additional step with heparin does not change the purity, oligomeric state, or the content of nucleic acid in the sample of N-HEAT_81-1643  (A<sub>260/280 </sub>=  0.7).</p>
<p>I also performed DSF, DSLS and DLS experiments with HTT N-HEAT_81-1643. The DSLS experiments show the construct aggregates at high temperatures around 80 °C. The DSF experiments showed the construct has a melting temperature around 46 °C. No significant difference in the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) or temperature of aggregation (T<sub>agg</sub>) was observed in the two buffer systems or protein concentrations tested.</p>
<p>The DLS experiments show that the HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 particles in solution have a radius of around 15 nm, implying the presence of large particles. These results are consistent with gel filtration chromatography results, which show N-HEAT_81-1643 elutes as a very large particle in solution (early elution volume). However, there is still the possibility that the construct HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 is in an extended conformation or in complex with nucleic acid material, which would also result in large particle size readings by DLS and gel filtration chromatography. So, in future experiments we will run negative stain experiments, which will tell us more about the conformation/oligomeric state of the sample.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s being a while since I wrote my first post. I have been busy in the lab trying to isolate monomeric and stable samples of the N-HEAT domain just as we demonstrated with the <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/purification-of-the-htt-c-heat-domain/">C-HEAT</a> domain (and by <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XYzlUmYpDb0">Dr. Rachel Harding)</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I summarize the results of the first round of purification of the huntingtin N-HEAT domain with boundaries 81-1643 (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3462496#.XYzkY2YpDb0">HTT N-HEAT_81-1643</a>).</p>
<p>The construct HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 encompasses the entire N &#8211; terminal HEAT domain (all 21 HEAT repeats) (Figure 1). This construct and a few others N-HEAT constructs (which I will be posting about later) were selected among several N-HEAT constructs initially made due to high levels of expression in Sf9 cells (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2600051#.XKU89aeZPOQ">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>). The first large scale purification of HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 showed this construct elutes early from the Superdex 200 10/300 column (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XULMtnspDb0">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>). This implied the construct was either in a high oligomeric state or an extended conformation.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HTT_N-HEAT_B08_illustrator_2-e1569590474153-300x244.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3607 aligncenter" width="330" height="268" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HTT_N-HEAT_B08_illustrator_2-e1569590474153-300x244.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HTT_N-HEAT_B08_illustrator_2-e1569590474153-768x624.png 768w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HTT_N-HEAT_B08_illustrator_2-e1569590474153-1024x833.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. Hunting structure (PDB 6ez8)<sup>1</sup>. N-HEAT (91-1641) colored in cyan</p>
<p>In <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3462496#.XYzkY2YpDb0">this purification</a>, I used a different gel filtration column (Superpose 6 10/300) which has a broader fractionation range of MW weights than the Superdex 200 column used initially. By using this column, I could better idea of the particle size of HTT N-HEAT construct. The results from this purification showed the construct also eluted early from the Superose 6 column (MW ~670 KDa- according to protein standards). Note that, if the construct was a monomer and had globular shape, it should a elute at a volume of around 16 &#8211; 17 mL (the monomer = 172 KDa). The gel filtration results imply that the construct is in a high oligomeric state likely a tetramer. However, it is still also possible that the construct is in an extended conformation and this would also result in an early elution volume from the gel filtration column (large hydrodynamic ratio). Yet another possible explanation is that HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 is in a complex with nucleic acid material as final A<sub>260/280</sub> readings of the purified samples of the HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 show high content of nucleic acid material (A<sub>260/280</sub> = 0.7). Future experiments with this HTT N-HEAT_81-1643 will aim at testing these hypotheses.</p>

<p>Figure 2. Gel filtration profile N-HEAT_81-1643 using a Superose 6 10/300 column. Elution volume of construct N-HEAT_81-1643 is 12.6 mL.</p>
<p>The sample that was obtained from this purification was used to set crystal trays and to test sample stability. To date, no crystals have been observed in any of the trays set for this construct. Regarding the sample stability, the samples are easily degraded at 4 °C in comparison with the <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/purification-of-the-htt-c-heat-domain/">C-HEAT</a> domain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am very excited to write my first post in open notebook. My post on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3358864#.XUQ673spA2w">Zenodo</a> summarizes the results of my first ever purification of a huntingtin (HTT) domain.

<p>Figure 1. Anti-FLAG purification of the HTT C-HEAT domain. Eluted protein is seen in the red box!</p>
<p>This purification was first done by <a href="http://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a> (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2628060#.XUQ4snspA2x">Zenodo</a>). Following her purification protocol, I obtained good yields of protein (0.45 mg of protein per L of Sp9 cells) which I immediately used to set crystal trays and to initiate biophysical characterization.</p>
<p>In future purifications, my aim is to improve purity as I noticed the sample was not very clean (low molecular weight proteins and nucleic acid). Further, I want to do a more stringent analysis to determine the most ideal buffer conditions for the sample using DSLS and DSF. I also would like to use SDS-PAGE and native PAGE to determine the progression of the limited proteolysis over time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I joined the group of Dr. Cheryl Arrowsmith 2 months ago. Currently, I am working on the Huntington’s disease project along with <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a> and <a href="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/category/scientist/jacob-mcauley/">Jacob McAuley</a>. During these past two months, I have been learning how to purify huntingtin (HTT) protein and overall getting up to date with the project.</p>
<p>A brief introduction to the project: HTT is a 348 KDa protein that is vital for development <sup>1</sup>. HTT has a polyglutamine repeat at its N-terminus which is normally no longer than 35 repeats (Figure 1). When this number of repeats exceeds 38 repeats, it causes Huntington’s disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurological disorder that occurs in adulthood and sometimes in children <sup>2</sup>. Thus, like many other neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, HD is also caused by a protein with an abnormal function in the cell. There are very limited treatments available for HD patients in part because there is little information about the function and structure of HTT and mutant HTT.</p>

<p>Figure 1. The huntingtin protein in normal population and in Huntington&#8217;s disease patients. Figure courtesy of <a href="https://labscribbles.com/">Dr. Rachel Harding</a>.</p>
<p>In the cell, HTT is thought to be involved in several important protein-protein interactions that are critical for cellular vesicular transport, endocytosis, autophagy and the regulation of transcription <sup>3,7</sup>. However, the complete picture of the function of HTT in the cell is yet not fully determined.</p>
<p>HTT is made up of three different domains. Two HEAT <sup>8,9</sup> (<u>H</u>untingtin, <u>E</u>longation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2<u>A</u>, <u>T</u>arget of rapamycin 1) domains at the N-terminus and C-terminus which are connected by a bridge. However, HTT has several disordered regions within these domains, which makes structural studies of HTT challenging. Recently, the cryo-EM structure of the protein was obtained making a huge step forward to understand more about HTT <sup>10</sup>. However, almost a quarter of the structure of HTT is still unknown in part due to the dynamic nature of this protein.</p>
<p>The main focus of my project is to obtain the 3D structure of the individual domains of the HTT protein, namely the N-terminal HEAT domain, the bridge and C-terminal HEAT domain. With this approach, we hope to better define structural elements in the protein. Further, studies with the individual domains will also be useful to understand what the role of each of the domains is within HTT. By learning about the structure and function of the individual domains, we can learn about HTT’s function inside the cell. I will be posting updates on the research progress so stay tuned!</p>
