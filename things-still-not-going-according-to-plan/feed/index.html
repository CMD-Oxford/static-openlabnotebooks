		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rachel, thanks for your comments. Expression still a problem, but I have some other mutants in the freezer I can try. I&#039;ve put several of these compounds through seeding, but haven&#039;t tried dehydration yet - next on list :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ros! Sorry to hear about your problems with protein expression. The crystals sound promising, do you have more of them? I&#039;m sure you&#039;re already on it but perhaps you could try dehydrating them or seeding them in a new plate screen? Has worked for me in the past. Best of luck! Rachel]]></description>
