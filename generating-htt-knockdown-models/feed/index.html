		<description><![CDATA[HTT staff,  Think crazy. Have you ever wondered if microplastics (&#060; 5 mm) are able to cross the blood-brain barrier? People have been ingesting microplastics since the mass-production of plastic bottles and their commercial usage beginning in the 1950&#039;s. Side note: People that drink wine, drink wine from glass bottles; drinking wine is part of the Mediterranean diet (fresh vegetables/no plastics (bisphenol A) = less neurodegeneration). Are the chemical compounds associated with microplastics (polypropylene and polyethylene/organophosphorus esters/phthlates) found in the brain tissue/cells of people with neurodegenerative/carcinogenic brain disorders? Gosh, fish ingest microplastics, people eat fish containing microplastics. Enjoy :-)]]></description>
