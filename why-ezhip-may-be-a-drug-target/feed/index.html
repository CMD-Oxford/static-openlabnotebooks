		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rachelle, Thanks for your interest in our research. I am very sorry to hear that your family is going through this situation. I am not a medical doctor, and my research is preclinical. Therefore I cannot advise you as a patient or include you in my study. After a quick search on the web, I found this website, which you might find helpful: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/ and further, they have a page that covers childhood brain cancers: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/page/12/childhood-brain-tumours. 
Thanks again for your comment. I hope you find the help and support you need, Rachelle.]]></description>
