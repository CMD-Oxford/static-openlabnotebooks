Rachelle, I just saw your comment. As it happens, I am part of a SU2C team working on brain tumours and one of our collaborators at SickKids in Toronto, Dr. Vijay Ramaswamy has started a clinical trial in children with Ependymoma using 5-azacytidine (a DNA methylation agent). You can find details here: 
 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03206021 
Vijay told me that there is a site in Melbourne, Australia that has joined the trial and has recently started recruitment. I suggest you get in touch with them. Here is the site and contact info: 
Royal Children&#039;s Hospital Melbourne	Recruiting
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
Contact: Jordan R Hansford, MBBS         
Principal Investigator: Jordan R Hansford, MBBS         
Feel free to email me if you need more details. 
You can reach me at takis.prinos@utoronto.ca]]></description>

Hi Rachelle, Thanks for your interest in our research. I am very sorry to hear that your family is going through this situation. I am not a medical doctor, and my research is preclinical. Therefore I cannot advise you as a patient or include you in my study. After a quick search on the web, I found this website, which you might find helpful: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/ and further, they have a page that covers childhood brain cancers: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/page/12/childhood-brain-tumours. 
Thanks again for your comment. I hope you find the help and support you need, Rachelle.]]></description>
