		<description><![CDATA[Dear David,

Thank you so much for the help!
We are indeed in touch with Matt and Jim from the Promega team. They had been tremendously helpful with our project!

Gratefully

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jong,

Are you still looking for at ALK5 Tracer? If so are you in contact with Promega R and D? I know we are making new tracers all the time and screening them against the whole Kinome so there are far more tracers available than commercially advertised. I&#039;ve asked if we have anything and I&#039;ll let you know.  I can also put you in touch with the product manager for NanoBRET TE if you want any tips on synthesising tracers if you want to try it again.

Regards

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Matthieu,

Thank you for the comment!
These custom-made tracers worked decently with ALK2 but not better than the current commercial Promega tracer. On top of that, more than 300 compounds has already been profiled using the commercial tracer.
Instead, when I get the time, I am intending to test them out for other Type I and Type II in the TGF-beta/BMP family since many of them still lack nanoBRET target engagement tracer. (fingers crossed)
It is really intriguing, structurally, what is causing ALK5 to not tolerate the additional bulk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jong Fu, the tracers turn-out useless for ALK5, but any merit in using them for ALK2 NanoBRET? (And great to see the unexpected SAR insight to make ALK2 inhibitors even more selective!)]]></description>
