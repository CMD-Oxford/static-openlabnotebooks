		<description><![CDATA[Dear Matthieu,

Thank you for the comment!
These custom-made tracers worked decently with ALK2 but not better than the current commercial Promega tracer. On top of that, more than 300 compounds has already been profiled using the commercial tracer.
Instead, when I get the time, I am intending to test them out for other Type I and Type II in the TGF-beta/BMP family since many of them still lack nanoBRET target engagement tracer. (fingers crossed)
It is really intriguing, structurally, what is causing ALK5 to not tolerate the additional bulk.]]></description>
