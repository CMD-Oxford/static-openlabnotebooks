Pietro - thanks for your comment. It&#039;s definitely a pressing question for us to figure out whether this variant localizes to the membrane. There were some initial studies conducted at Emory on this variant, but they were inconclusive. Hope to have an answer/update for you soon ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome Katheron - and your elegant results! Has anyone tested if Tyr647Ser GRIN1 localises to the membrane or whether it is retained in the ER and/or degraded by ERAD? Are there any other rare-disease associated GRIN1 mutations that produce mutant GRIN1 retaining some of its activity - but again  it is retained in the ER and/or degraded by ERAD? I am asking for a friend :-)]]></description>
