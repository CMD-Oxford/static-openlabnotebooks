		<description><![CDATA[Hello, my name is Juan Nil and I think you are a very handsome man. I once finished 3rd in a robot dancing competition in my village. Good times. I think the Mighty, Mighty Arsenal is the best soccer team in the world, correct? I also like Lil&#039;pool, but does not fancy London Sp*rs. 

Keep up the good work,
Juan Nil]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will admit that I might be a little biased, but life in Montreal and Canada really is great. ALthought we are in summer at the moment, so everything is better, so cold and winter does take adjusting to, but it could be worst. There are many great PIs here, and lot of people are doing great work in Neurodevelopmental biology. Just one example, this guy. Carl Ernst (https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/carl-ernst), he is superstar who has flown under radar for too long but is going to be making big impact over coming months, lot of great stuff is coming from his lab, although you would need to excuse his hair. Besides development, neuroinflammation and pain are two big areas at the MNI and in other Montreal universities with many working on them, so you would be spoiled for choice. Plus the day and night life isn&#039;t too bad, nice cafes, bars, great food and a joie de vivre hard to find anywhere else. Downside is construction, as we are currently rebuilding the entire city, so orange cone manufacturers are making huge money. But all in all, its great place and you should give it thought, as this city is always looking for newcomers to join our family here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 


Only just found this blog from a newsfeed pop-up. Glad to hear you taking some time out for yourself!
I&#039;m a 2nd year PhD student at Cardiff who works on cerebral organoids (took my first year just to create a set-up) and am fascinated with them too - my childhood dream was to make Pokemon rather than dinosaurs! I was wondering about what McGill University is like, and life in Quebec, as I am seriously thinking of a postdoc there (but not for at least another two years!). I&#039;ve only heard good things so far. I work in neurodevelopmental disorders but really want to span into neuroinflammation and related diseases like fibromyalgia, ME and complex regional pain syndrome and have seen great work come out of the Alan Edwards Centre of Pain. Would love to hear back from you!]]></description>
