		<description><![CDATA[You might consider combining two ideas/approaches with any promising compounds you might have by using magnetic nano-particles for drug delivery &#038; ultrasound.

Magnetic nano-particles will cross the blood/brain barrier and ultrasound opens the tumor target site for increased drug delivery.  Years ago, CalTech &#038; Children&#039;s Hospital used magnetic nano-particles (encapsulated in a soft capsule to swallow like Contact(tm)) in an experimental approach for the treatment of  Neuroblastoma(NB) by coating the magnetic nano-particles so that one-antigen/one antibody of Neuroblastoma would combine together and this was then filtered out of blood during blood transfusions using magnets.
