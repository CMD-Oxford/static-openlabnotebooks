					<description><![CDATA[Here is the most recent publication with other modifications to the protocol.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31809900
In the methods section, the authors specify that they incubated the digested peptides with antibody beads overnight:
&quot;To enrich different types of modified peptides, six kinds of panantibodies beads that were specific against Kme1, Kme2, or Kme3 lysine; or MMA, aDMA, or sDMA were used. Trypsin-digested peptides dissolved in NETN buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% NP-40; pH 8.0) were individually incubated with the six kinds of
specific antibody beads at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking according to the manufacturer&#039;s instructions&quot;]]></description>
