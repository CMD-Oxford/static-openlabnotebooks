				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hello Open World!<br />
</em><em>In this very first post I will give an overview of my current and future research on malaria. I would like to sincerely thank everyone here (particularly Matthieu and Mandeep) for welcoming me so warmly. </em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ABSTRACT:</span><br />
A major challenge for the elimination of malaria is <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>asymptomatic infections, the hidden infectious reservoir. Yet I believe these infections can provide useful information on the host-pathogen interactions over an extended period of time. My research aims to understand how <em>P. falciparum </em>parasites can survive in chronic infections over the 6-month long dry season, using an already available collection of blood samples from a cohort of asymptomatic volunteers in The Gambia. With whole genome sequencing, we will identify parasite alleles under selection during the dry season population bottleneck. With single-cell RNA-seq, we will explore how the parasite senses its environment and adapt to it. With qPCR and flow cytometry, we will test the central dogma that antigenic variation is at the basis of a chronic infection. This work will greatly advance our understanding of the parasite, host and vector interactions, and could reveal key molecular drivers of asymptomatic infections, a critical step to enable the eradication of malaria.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION:</span></p>
<p><strong>Basic facts about malaria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Caused by <em>Plasmodium </em>parasites (unicellular eukaryote)</li>
<li>Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes</li>
<li><em>Plasmodium </em>parasites spend most of their asexual life inside red blood cells, with a reinvasion cycle every 48 hours.</li>
<li>Over half a million deaths per year, mainly children in Sub-Saharan Africa infected with <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Malaria in The Gambia, West Africa</strong></p>
<p>Where malaria transmission is seasonal such as The Gambia in West Africa, this occurs during and immediately after the rains (June-December). During the dry season (January-May) there is no transmission, hardly any clinical case is diagnosed during these dry months, and there are fewer mosquitoes[1,2]. Most of these infections will clear naturally, inducing a parasite population bottleneck (Fig. 1). However some <em>P. falciparum </em>parasites survive by establishing chronic, asymptomatic infections across the whole dry season. These infections are the reservoir from which the seasonal peak will restart at the next transmission season.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>My current research focuses on <em>P. falciparum</em> asymptomatic infections for three main reasons:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em> Asymptomatic infections: out of sight, out of mind</em></li>
</ol>
<p>On any given day, the vast majority of all <em>P. falciparum </em>infections are asymptomatic, yet they have been poorly investigated (Fig 2). Currently, our knowledge of the parasite biology is based on isolates derived from clinical cases, and usually from clonal culture-adapted parasites. How asymptomatic infections differ from clinical cases has hardly ever been investigated, with no genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome or phenotypic description of such parasites published to date, due to the technical challenges associated with very low amount of biological material. Today’s technology is at a turning point for addressing these issues.</p>

<li><em> Asymptomatic infections, a challenge for malaria elimination</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This reservoir, shown to produce gametocytes and transmit them[4], represents the biggest challenge for malaria eradication. However, clearing all infections would include treating carriers without clinical symptoms who are unlikely to seek treatment. A campaign that would only target clinical cases, the most virulent forms of the parasite, is at risk of inadvertently selecting for a population with an “asymptomatic profile” (i.e. low-parasitaemia, chronic infections), complicating the elimination effort.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em> Asymptomatic infections as a new model for host-pathogen interactions</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, pathogenesis studies typically collect a single blood sample from the patient on its arrival at hospital, giving us only a snapshot of the host-pathogen interaction. I believe we could “record the video” of the host-pathogen interaction with regular blood sampling of the same chronic asymptomatic carrier, to study the evolution of the same infection in real time (Fig 3).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1354" src="https://openlabnotebooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ofig3-300x96.png" alt="" width="238" height="76" srcset="https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ofig3-300x96.png 300w, https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ofig3.png 451w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" />    <strong>Figure 3</strong></p>
<p>This is why in The Gambia we recruited a cohort of ~50 volunteers who were asymptomatic carriers at the start of the dry season (December 2016). These individuals were sampled monthly for up to 6 months. Epidemiology results will be described in a separate post.<br />
Understanding how the parasite can survive in a human host for months will help us develop novel genetic surveillance &amp; therapeutic tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AIMS</span>:</p>
<p>To understand how the parasite is able to survive over the dry season, and start a new epidemic at the following wet season, we will characterize <em>P. falciparum </em>from chronic infections, at the genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic levels, as well as the associated host immune response. More specifically:</p>
<p><strong>Project 1: Identifying P. falciparum alleles under selection during the dry season</strong></p>
<p>Sequencing of <em>P. falciparum </em>genomes collected during the wet and dry season will identify parasite alleles that are selected for by the parasite population bottleneck due to the lack of transmission in the dry season.</p>
<p><strong>Project 2: Can <em>P. falciparum </em>sense its environment and adapt to it via transcriptional regulation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2a</strong>: We will measure the in vitro parasite multiplication rate to determine whether isolates from asymptomatic infections grow slower than virulent infections.</p>
<p><strong>2b</strong>: Using single-cell (sc) RNA-seq, we will compare the transcriptome of parasites collected in dry and wet seasons. Our hypothesis is that at the start of the dry season some subpopulations of parasites switch to a dormant-like state.</p>
<p><strong>Project 3: Can antigenic variation explain chronic infections?</strong></p>
<p>We will record <em>var</em> gene expression switching and its associated immune response monthly over the course of the same infections. This will reveal a long postulated but never formally tested hypothesis that variant surface antigen switching is sufficient for the parasite to evade the host immune system.</p>

<p>Hello world! I think I should let you know about the two diseases my project covers before we get started:<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/understanding-brain-tumours/types-brain-tumour-children/dipg-diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma/">diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma</a> (DIPG for short) is a childhood brain tumour that grows in a part of the brainstem called the pons. The disease progresses rapidly and the fact that it grows within the brainstem, and invades into nearby tissue means that complete surgical removal is impossible. Furthermore, there are currently no effective chemotherapeutics, meaning that only 10% of patients live longer than 2 years following diagnosis. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="http://omim.org/entry/135100?search=fibrodysplasia%20ossificans%20progressiva&amp;highlight=fibrodysplasia%20ossifican%20progressiva">Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</a> (FOP) is a rare genetic disorder that causes soft tissues in the body to turn into bone (called heterotopic ossification), which causes progressive immobility and co-morbidities. As inflammation can trigger heterotopic ossification, surgical attempts to remove the bone only serve to trigger even more to grow, and again there are currently no chemotherapeutics able to slow or reverse the formation of heterotopic bone.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642017?access_num=16642017&amp;link_type=MED&amp;dopt=Abstract">In 2006</a> it was discovered that 100% of FOP patients have mutations in a gene called <i>ACVR1</i>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705252">in 2014</a> it was found that 25% of DIPG patients also have mutations in <i>ACVR1 </i>(along with other mutations). This gene encodes a receptor (ALK2) that sits on the cell surface, and is normally activated by ligands called bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). FOP and DIPG mutations in <i>ACVR1 </i>mean that is can also be activated by a second set of ligands, called activins, and this leads to extra activation of this signalling pathway in FOP and DIPG cells. In FOP this causes muscle cells to mis-differentiate into bone cells. In DIPG cells this contributes to the formation of cancer, but exactly how is not yet known. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p>T<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">he aim of my project is to use cells originally from FOP and DIPG </span>patients to understand how the mutations change how the ALK2 protein interacts with signalling networks within the cell, and how these changes in signalling alter the behaviour of cells so that they become cancerous. In addition, I will complete a small screen of small molecule compounds that may be therapeutically effective against DIPG cells. I hope that my work will contribute to developing chemotherapeutics that can slow or reverse the progression of FOP and DIPG. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank the groups funding this project: the Simcox family, <a href="http://www.fopfriends.com/">FOP friends</a>, and <a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/">The Brain Tumour Charity</a>.
