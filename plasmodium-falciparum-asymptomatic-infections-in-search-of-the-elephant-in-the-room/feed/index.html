		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Most malaria deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, a unicellular eukaryote parasite transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Despite the heavy burden of the disease, most human infections are asymptomatic (afebrile) and can last for months/years. In regions where malaria is seasonal, such as in The Gambia, West Africa, it is thought that these asymptomatic infections act as a reservoir during the dry season when there is no or little transmission. Long-lasting infections could be turned to our advantage if we study them as a new host-pathogen interaction model, by regular sampling of an asymptomatic volunteer, investigating the parasite biology in its natural environment. More details on our research can be found on this on this post. [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very useful for our current works in mathematical models of control  malaria, as we can incorporate now this  annual cyclicity and consider two separate groups of infectious.
Thanks for sharing under open science.
All the best]]></description>
