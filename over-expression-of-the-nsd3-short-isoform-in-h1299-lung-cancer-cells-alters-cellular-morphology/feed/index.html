		<description><![CDATA[I’m sure there are other very sensible explanations for the phenotype. Also, important to keep in mind that EMT occurs along a spectrum, the degree to which NSD3 may (or may not!) influence this process and what that means in the context of a cancer cell are big questions that will require a lot more work to sort out.  Early days, but I think given what we do know about NSD3 &amp; Myc signalling, it’s an interesting hypothesis to pursue.]]></description>
