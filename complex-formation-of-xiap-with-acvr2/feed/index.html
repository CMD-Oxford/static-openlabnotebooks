This is very possible so I&#039;m not going to waste more time with this construct of XIAP which contains only the BIR2 domain of the protein (but was the most readily available to test at the time within the SGC since we had the clones for it already). The other construct of XIAP that I&#039;ve now got from our collaborator is of the full length protein which consists of three BIR domains and a RING domain. Given this protein is expressed in E.coli and so is fairly quick and easy to produce it seems worth repeating the pull-down before moving on completely. I&#039;ve still got protein left from the last pull down I did so the only protein I need to purify is the full length XIAP. Hopefully this won&#039;t take too long!]]></description>
