					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/shockingly-effective-electroporation-of-ribonucleoprotein-complexes-into-dipg-cells/#comment-1272&quot;&gt;ONC201&lt;/a&gt;.

Interesting ! I&#039;d never heard about Irreversible Electroporation for prostate cancer. I&#039;ve not heard IRE being used in brain tumours, but there were a handful of abstracts covering &quot;Tumour Treating Fields&quot; for brain tumours at the AACR Annual Meeting this year (here&#039;s one of them: https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/13_Supplement/CT008). 

I don&#039;t know a lot about prions, but I don&#039;t think they would specifically kill cancer cells over normal cells, and can&#039;t immediately see anything in the literature about anyone else looking at this as a therapeutic option.]]></description>

Yes, I&#039;ve seen that paper and it does look like a wonderful technique! We just wanted to stick with a technique that works with electroporation of RNPs because it seems deliver the components at much higher efficiency than any plasmid transfection we&#039;ve done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great, can just elektroporotion also help to diminish the tumortissue like with prostatecancer? 

And is there also a possiblity to use prions and change them. I mean if with Creutzfeldt-Jakob braincells turn into mush, why couldn&#039;t we use prions to target a specific cancercell?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Elizabeth, 

Have you taken a look as the PrimeEditing paper in Nature last month? If it works as well as they say it does it should be a lot easier to put small mutations(e.g. Point mutations) into your cells with much lower off target effects.(the enzyme doesn&#039;t cleave the DNA you just right the change into the genome).
