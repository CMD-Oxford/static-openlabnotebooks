					<description><![CDATA[Hi Elizabeth, 

Have you taken a look as the PrimeEditing paper in Nature last month? If it works as well as they say it does it should be a lot easier to put small mutations(e.g. Point mutations) into your cells with much lower off target effects.(the enzyme doesn&#039;t cleave the DNA you just right the change into the genome).
