We tried the HTT shRNAs in GBM stem cells but didn&#039;t observe any phenotypes. In contrast, PRMT5 inhibition shows a strong effect on GBM stem cell self-renewal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesgc.github.io/static-openlabnotebooks/reduction-of-htt-protein-through-chemical-inhibition/#comment-221&quot;&gt;Matthieu&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Matthieu! I used both GSK591 and LLY283 at 1  µM, which was the concentration we screened the compounds at. However, by looking at the reduction in HTT protein levels, LLY283 seems to be more potent than GSK591 and was able to induce a greater downregulation of HTT protein levels at the same concentration asGSK591. This might be due to the difference in the way GSK591 and LLY283 work as they inhibit PRMT5 through different mechanisms, or it might simply be due to differences in their chemical properties, which affect how easily they can enter the cells.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very cool, Jolene. What PRMT5 inhibitor concentration did you use? 

... And looking forward to seeing the effect on mutant HTT levels!]]></description>
