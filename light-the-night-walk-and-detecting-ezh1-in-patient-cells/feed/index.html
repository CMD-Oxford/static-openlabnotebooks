					<description><![CDATA[I would *strongly* suggest you engineer an EZH1 knock-out line as a negative control and do not use mobility on a gel as a signal of a positive antibody.   In our antibody validation projects we have identified quite a few antibodies that recognize a band of the right size...only to see the same band in the knock-out lines.  It&#039;s really worth the effort]]></description>
