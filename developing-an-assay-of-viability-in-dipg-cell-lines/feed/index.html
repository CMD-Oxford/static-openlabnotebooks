		<description><![CDATA[Yes I do all my assays in spheres or organoids, and sometimes when I have a hit, I try it in the same patient line but grown in 2D and the response to some of our inhibitors is very different (adherent can be more resistant to some probes). 3D models are not as easy to work with but more relevant I think! I don&#039;t have that many assays for them though, mostly viability (CTG or flow cytometry), limiting dilution assays. I&#039;d love to do more imaging!  I think it&#039;s really cool that you tried PI in your spheres, I was actually going to try the new cytoplasmic incucyte dye  at some point, they claim they&#039;re non toxic :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi :)

I&#039;m initially doing two dimensional assays so that I can compare my results to those of other groups, because this is the standard they use (and have published), but I&#039;ll also be doing 3D assays to compare the results (which is what I was optimising in this post: https://opennotebook.thesgc.org/making-single-dipg-spheres/ )

Do you do all your assays in three dimensions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Liz!
I was wondering, since your readout is Celltiterglo anyway, why do you choose to do the assay on adherent cells as opposed to the original spheres? CTG works very well on spheres, and there are several reports showing that adherent cells do not respond to compounds with the same sensitivity as spheres. I work on spheres myself so Iâ€™m always glad to hear perspectives/comments from other sphere users  :)

Cheers
