Dear Caroline - I&#039;m glad to be helping however I can. I learn so much from the chordoma community and hope it is helping me be better at what I do and affecting how I go about each day.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello David - Josh and I connected last week and he sent me a link to your blog.  Thank you for sharing details about this journey.  For me it is incredible, and humbling, to learn about the human side of drug discovery:  The passion generated through personal stories and connections resulting in this exciting project which was 18 years in the making!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for caring about the 1 in a Million and giving us hope. It always seems that there is only help/options for people with a common disease.  
My 6 year old was diagnosed a few months ago with clivus chordoma. 
We wish you all the best for your studies.
Please keep us posted.]]></description>
