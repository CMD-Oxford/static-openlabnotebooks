					<description><![CDATA[Rachelle, I just saw your comment. As it happens, I am part of a SU2C team working on brain tumours and one of our collaborators at SickKids in Toronto, Dr. Vijay Ramaswamy has started a clinical trial in children with Ependymoma using 5-azacytidine (a DNA methylation agent). You can find details here: 
 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03206021 
Vijay told me that there is a site in Melbourne, Australia that has joined the trial and has recently started recruitment. I suggest you get in touch with them. Here is the site and contact info: 
Royal Children&#039;s Hospital Melbourne	Recruiting
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
Contact: Jordan R Hansford, MBBS         
Principal Investigator: Jordan R Hansford, MBBS         
Feel free to email me if you need more details. 
You can reach me at takis.prinos@utoronto.ca]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pietro - thanks for your comment. It&#039;s definitely a pressing question for us to figure out whether this variant localizes to the membrane. There were some initial studies conducted at Emory on this variant, but they were inconclusive. Hope to have an answer/update for you soon ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome Katheron - and your elegant results! Has anyone tested if Tyr647Ser GRIN1 localises to the membrane or whether it is retained in the ER and/or degraded by ERAD? Are there any other rare-disease associated GRIN1 mutations that produce mutant GRIN1 retaining some of its activity - but again  it is retained in the ER and/or degraded by ERAD? I am asking for a friend :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Rachelle, Thanks for your interest in our research. I am very sorry to hear that your family is going through this situation. I am not a medical doctor, and my research is preclinical. Therefore I cannot advise you as a patient or include you in my study. After a quick search on the web, I found this website, which you might find helpful: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/ and further, they have a page that covers childhood brain cancers: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/page/12/childhood-brain-tumours. 
Thanks again for your comment. I hope you find the help and support you need, Rachelle.]]></description>
