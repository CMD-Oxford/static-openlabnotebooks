		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rezaul, thanks for that information - I might have a go at trying this if the new crystal system doesn&#039;t work. With fragment screening, one has to mount a couple of hundred crystals in a few hours, so digging around friable crystals trying to get the sticky skin off makes that amount of mounting very inefficient. Did you put the EG in the crystallisation condition or soak after the crystals grew?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent! Thanks for the post. One of my protein crystals were also grown inside the membrenous drops, as you described. Though after 20-30min of  tedious microsurgery under the microscope, I separated the crystals, but some sticky membrane fragments remained stuck with the crystals &#038; showed some smudgy diffractions. I added 5-15%% ethylene glycol in the protein condition &#038; that solved the membrane problem!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Caleb, that&#039;s a great introduction! Our group in Oxford will soon start posting data on crystal structures of Brachyury.
By the way, the Human Genome Organization has finally changed the official name from &quot;T&quot; to &quot;TBXT&quot; (T-box protein T).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Matthieu! I used both GSK591 and LLY283 at 1  ÂµM, which was the concentration we screened the compounds at. However, by looking at the reduction in HTT protein levels, LLY283 seems to be more potent than GSK591 and was able to induce a greater downregulation of HTT protein levels at the same concentration asGSK591. This might be due to the difference in the way GSK591 and LLY283 work as they inhibit PRMT5 through different mechanisms, or it might simply be due to differences in their chemical properties, which affect how easily they can enter the cells.]]></description>

... And looking forward to seeing the effect on mutant HTT levels!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would *strongly* suggest you engineer an EZH1 knock-out line as a negative control and do not use mobility on a gel as a signal of a positive antibody.   In our antibody validation projects we have identified quite a few antibodies that recognize a band of the right size...only to see the same band in the knock-out lines.  It&#039;s really worth the effort]]></description>
