		<description><![CDATA[Dear Matthieu,

Thank you for the comment!
These custom-made tracers worked decently with ALK2 but not better than the current commercial Promega tracer. On top of that, more than 300 compounds has already been profiled using the commercial tracer.
Instead, when I get the time, I am intending to test them out for other Type I and Type II in the TGF-beta/BMP family since many of them still lack nanoBRET target engagement tracer. (fingers crossed)
It is really intriguing, structurally, what is causing ALK5 to not tolerate the additional bulk.]]></description>

		<title>Comment on ZFYVE9C purification and association test with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 by Ellie Williams</title>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a fair point - I think my hope with at least the initial experiment was that if I had seen an association (and given it&#039;s presumed function in the pathway it wasn&#039;t an impossibility and I&#039;d have felt very foolish not to at least try such an easy experiment) I could have instantly set it up in crystal plates which would have been very interesting.
There have been a few studies indicating a few other potential binding partners including TOM1 which I&#039;ve looked at in the past and while I&#039;ve been able to detect an interaction by ITC I&#039;ve not been able to get a crystal structure. The fold of the DUF domain is similar to the fold of SUFU in the hedgehog pathway but there is very little sequence similarity so it&#039;s hard to predict how the binding site and substrates of SUFU will map to ZFYVE9C. 
In cell studies is something to consider too. It&#039;s not where my expertise lies but I&#039;m hoping to talk to Jong Fu about whether he&#039;s got any thoughts on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If it were me, I&#039;d drop it and think of a more agnostic (unbiased) way to test its function
Your approach is almost always a losing game, since a negative result is meaningless and it takes years to gain confidence in any interaction (since you &quot;forced&quot; the proteins to interact, you&#039;d need to go back into cells, do mutants etc)

so why not just start with the cell experiment and ask &quot;what co-purifies with it&quot;?]]></description>
