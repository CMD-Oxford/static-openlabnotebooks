		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rachelle, Thanks for your interest in our research. I am very sorry to hear that your family is going through this situation. I am not a medical doctor, and my research is preclinical. Therefore I cannot advise you as a patient or include you in my study. After a quick search on the web, I found this website, which you might find helpful: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/ and further, they have a page that covers childhood brain cancers: https://www.curebraincancer.org.au/page/12/childhood-brain-tumours. 
Thanks again for your comment. I hope you find the help and support you need, Rachelle.]]></description>

Thank you so much for the help!
We are indeed in touch with Matt and Jim from the Promega team. They had been tremendously helpful with our project!

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jong,

Are you still looking for at ALK5 Tracer? If so are you in contact with Promega R and D? I know we are making new tracers all the time and screening them against the whole Kinome so there are far more tracers available than commercially advertised. I&#039;ve asked if we have anything and I&#039;ll let you know.  I can also put you in touch with the product manager for NanoBRET TE if you want any tips on synthesising tracers if you want to try it again.

Regards

David]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Elizabeth, 

Have you taken a look as the PrimeEditing paper in Nature last month? If it works as well as they say it does it should be a lot easier to put small mutations(e.g. Point mutations) into your cells with much lower off target effects.(the enzyme doesn&#039;t cleave the DNA you just right the change into the genome).
