		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a fair point - I think my hope with at least the initial experiment was that if I had seen an association (and given it&#039;s presumed function in the pathway it wasn&#039;t an impossibility and I&#039;d have felt very foolish not to at least try such an easy experiment) I could have instantly set it up in crystal plates which would have been very interesting.
There have been a few studies indicating a few other potential binding partners including TOM1 which I&#039;ve looked at in the past and while I&#039;ve been able to detect an interaction by ITC I&#039;ve not been able to get a crystal structure. The fold of the DUF domain is similar to the fold of SUFU in the hedgehog pathway but there is very little sequence similarity so it&#039;s hard to predict how the binding site and substrates of SUFU will map to ZFYVE9C. 
In cell studies is something to consider too. It&#039;s not where my expertise lies but I&#039;m hoping to talk to Jong Fu about whether he&#039;s got any thoughts on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If it were me, I&#039;d drop it and think of a more agnostic (unbiased) way to test its function
Your approach is almost always a losing game, since a negative result is meaningless and it takes years to gain confidence in any interaction (since you &quot;forced&quot; the proteins to interact, you&#039;d need to go back into cells, do mutants etc)

so why not just start with the cell experiment and ask &quot;what co-purifies with it&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rezaul, thanks for that information - I might have a go at trying this if the new crystal system doesn&#039;t work. With fragment screening, one has to mount a couple of hundred crystals in a few hours, so digging around friable crystals trying to get the sticky skin off makes that amount of mounting very inefficient. Did you put the EG in the crystallisation condition or soak after the crystals grew?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent! Thanks for the post. One of my protein crystals were also grown inside the membrenous drops, as you described. Though after 20-30min of  tedious microsurgery under the microscope, I separated the crystals, but some sticky membrane fragments remained stuck with the crystals &#038; showed some smudgy diffractions. I added 5-15%% ethylene glycol in the protein condition &#038; that solved the membrane problem!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Caleb, that&#039;s a great introduction! Our group in Oxford will soon start posting data on crystal structures of Brachyury.
By the way, the Human Genome Organization has finally changed the official name from &quot;T&quot; to &quot;TBXT&quot; (T-box protein T).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Matthieu! I used both GSK591 and LLY283 at 1  ÂµM, which was the concentration we screened the compounds at. However, by looking at the reduction in HTT protein levels, LLY283 seems to be more potent than GSK591 and was able to induce a greater downregulation of HTT protein levels at the same concentration asGSK591. This might be due to the difference in the way GSK591 and LLY283 work as they inhibit PRMT5 through different mechanisms, or it might simply be due to differences in their chemical properties, which affect how easily they can enter the cells.]]></description>
