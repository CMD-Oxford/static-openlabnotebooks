		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I am from Australia, we are also interested in using the BacMam system, we will be using CHO cells, was wondering if you could share a detailed protocol for the transfection and transduction.

		<description><![CDATA[The mice arrived in Toronto and are out of quarantine! We tried to see if we could tell which mice carried the variant just by handling them. The Y647S mice seem healthy but are slightly smaller than their wildtype littermates. We are looking forward to more quantitative phenotyping.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The compounds work in our in vitro assay (IC50 in nM range), but I do not have any proof that they really work in cells. In original paper the authors mentioned that cellular IC50 is lower than 20 nM based on results from Nanoluc tracer experiment, but I have not seen any data on this. 
Recent paper (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acschembio.9b00292?rand=jqrhoi7j) showed that FT895 is not affecting SHMT2 palmitolylation up to 50 uM. I would like to try sis17, the novel HDAC11 inhibitor in this system and I am currently taking totally different approach for assay development. Soon I should be able to post the data.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Magdalena
you probably have recombinant purified protein of hdac11 available. did you test the tool cpds used in CETSA (i assume that is the 201 and 202 curves) on purified protein. just to be sure that there is not something else wrong with the cpds

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tom, Yes completely agree, human neurons from the brain would be ideal much like in cancer where to study the human disease we can obtain cells from every patient biopsy, but getting neurons from the brain of a person comes with challenges. Often access to material is severely limited, and the quality can vary from surgery to surgery. It also depends on why the surgery was does, as often there was an underlying condition being corrected, so for tissue to be removed, it would mean there may be some underlying problem with the neurons and associated cells. The other deterring factor is while we can get tissue, it has a finite lifespan, and can&#039;t be expanded beyond what the starting material is. Stem cells at least alleviated a lot of these issues, we can grow a patients cells and make any cell type we want when we want, and we never have to worry about material being available. Yes it has its limitations, but it has opened up a lot of doors and possibilities that weren&#039;t there ten years ago.]]></description>
