Interesting ! I&#039;d never heard about Irreversible Electroporation for prostate cancer. I&#039;ve not heard IRE being used in brain tumours, but there were a handful of abstracts covering &quot;Tumour Treating Fields&quot; for brain tumours at the AACR Annual Meeting this year (here&#039;s one of them: https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/13_Supplement/CT008). 

I don&#039;t know a lot about prions, but I don&#039;t think they would specifically kill cancer cells over normal cells, and can&#039;t immediately see anything in the literature about anyone else looking at this as a therapeutic option.]]></description>

Yes, I&#039;ve seen that paper and it does look like a wonderful technique! We just wanted to stick with a technique that works with electroporation of RNPs because it seems deliver the components at much higher efficiency than any plasmid transfection we&#039;ve done.]]></description>

Really interesting method. Could this difference in assay sensitivity be attributed to the higher intrinsic stability of nanoluciferase compared to the split nanoluciferase in HiBIT/LgBiT system?]]></description>

Thank you. I will try. I currently stopped using NL-tagged constructs. CETSA with HiBIT/LgBiT system gives my much better results.]]></description>

Thank you - the reference has been added to the paper describing the work at https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15893.1 (preprint at the moment - we are awaiting referee reports).]]></description>
