Hey Al, thanks for your comment! I totally agree with your quote that we tend to see interactions the more we study a particular protein or gene. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an issue with the antibodies though, I get pretty clean bands for most of the targets I looked at, and the HTT antibody, which is the most important antibody since it&#039;s for my direct protein of interest, works great (it is a rabbit monoclonal from abcam and I highly recommend it to anyone looking at HTT: https://www.abcam.com/huntingtin-antibody-epr5526-ab109115.html). However, you&#039;re right that the experimental design can be further improved. Most of these papers that I&#039;ve been looking at are in different lines and they have mostly been focused on mutant HTT, which I&#039;ve had trouble overexpressing since it&#039;s so large. Moving forward, I&#039;ll be focusing on WT HTT for now, since the overexpression for those seem to be working, rather than trying to tease out if my experiment didn&#039;t work because of the poor overexpression of mutant HTT.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if you might have better luck designing the experiment differently.  Rather then chase down the observations of others (most of which will be artifactual), why not design the experiments in a more unbiased way?

I recall the quote &quot;the number of proteins with which a protein interacts is directly proportional to the number of people that work on that protein&quot;

You have more purified protein than anyone else - have you access to a kick-ass monoclonal(s)? make some?
 
Have the ones you used been rigorously characterized on cells and k/o cells in parallel to make sure they are specific and selective?]]></description>
