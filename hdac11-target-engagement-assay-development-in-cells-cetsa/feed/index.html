		<description><![CDATA[The compounds work in our in vitro assay (IC50 in nM range), but I do not have any proof that they really work in cells. In original paper the authors mentioned that cellular IC50 is lower than 20 nM based on results from Nanoluc tracer experiment, but I have not seen any data on this. 
Recent paper (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acschembio.9b00292?rand=jqrhoi7j) showed that FT895 is not affecting SHMT2 palmitolylation up to 50 uM. I would like to try sis17, the novel HDAC11 inhibitor in this system and I am currently taking totally different approach for assay development. Soon I should be able to post the data.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Magdalena
you probably have recombinant purified protein of hdac11 available. did you test the tool cpds used in CETSA (i assume that is the 201 and 202 curves) on purified protein. just to be sure that there is not something else wrong with the cpds
