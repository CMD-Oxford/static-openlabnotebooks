		<description><![CDATA[Hi Howard, thanks for your comment! Yes, you are right that there are a number of studies that have shown cancer incidence is lower in patients suffering from HD, and this paper published recently by Murmann et al. in EMBO Reports (http://embor.embopress.org/content/early/2018/02/07/embr.201745336) showed some very interesting findings on how the huntingtin trinucleotide repeat might have the potential to be developed into a cancer therapy, which has very exciting implications for both the fields of cancer and HD! It&#039;s a great idea to follow up on other gens that are dysregulated with the onset of HD. This might not only provide us with other targets for potential cancer and HD therapy, but will shed light on the mechanisms involved, especially in the case of cancer, which as you say, is a multistep process. Moreover, different cancers have different aetiologies, and therefore therapies are becoming more targeted and personalised. There are some known dysregulated genes in HD, such as dopamine receptors, huntingtin interacting proteins and even transport proteins, and they are definitely worth looking at for both cancer and HD.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Important research you are doing.  Huntington patients have fewer cancers than the population.  A group studying this found the Huntington gene has has significant cancer-fighting properties leading to questions about treatment for both diseases.    My understanding is that cancer involves a multi-step process and I wonder if  there any other genes you found that were impacted  by Huntington&#039;s.   If another gene is elevated, that could be a target too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The etiology of HD is the expansion of Q repeats or CAG repeats in the HTT gene, which produces the huntingtin protein. This causes improper folding of the protein and leads to protein aggregation in neuronal cells, which ultimately causes the movement, cognitive and psychiatric impairment we see in people with HD. You can read more about HTT and HD in my earlier blog post here (https://opennotebook.thesgc.org/background-on-htt-and-hd/). [&#8230;]]]></description>
