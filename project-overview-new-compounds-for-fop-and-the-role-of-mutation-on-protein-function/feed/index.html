		<description><![CDATA[We have tried the morpholine group as part of the LDN series both in our internal chemistry efforts and as part of a collaboration with ICR in London. There should be a paper published imminently containing the structure of one of these compounds along with some detailed discussion of the chemistry. The morpholinyl compounds were well tolerated, the group tends to point into the solvent channel and thus the hinge and back of pocket contacts are not disrupted. There is some indication that the morpholine group can form water mediated contacts with residues in the solvent channel, however this region in all the compounds we&#039;ve studied tends to show a high flexibility regardless of group and thus doesn&#039;t seem to provide significant extra specificity or potency.]]></description>
